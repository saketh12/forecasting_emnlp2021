While international satellites can often be used to image above ground areas, imaging for underwater is harder to provide.  Water is a phenomenal heat-sink.  Even if there is a heat-sensing (infra-red) satellite or ship, any warmth from the submarine would have long since been distributed among millions of gallons of water.  That leaves sonar and radar.  The platforms hosting those sensors have to be relatively close to an object to detect it, once on the sea floor.  I have heard that there is magnetic sensing.  I do not know of what substance this submarine is constructed.
