Many US air strikes on al-Shabaab targets since Trump took office have succeeded in killing hundreds of militants. Additionally, African Union forces remain active in Somalia to counter Al-Shabaab. Despite these facts, a chance of an attack on US diplomatic facilities does exist. Al-Shabaab is ideologically opposed to the West and thus may counter the increase in US involvement with a direct attack. Another possible path to attack on US diplomatic facilities could pan out as African Union troops continue to pull out of Somalia. With the Somalian government still weak and disorganized, al-Shabaab could regain former territories and increase its presence and power in the region, putting all targets, including US diplomatic facilities, at increased risk.
