I assume she will frame this issue as one of outside militias vs. the state of Myanmar against which people will have to unify. There are a lot of fake news out there (from both sides) and most people inside Myanmar probably believe that fleeing Rohingyas burned down their houses themselves to be able to accuse the government of ethnic cleansing and damage it's reputation. There are some video campaigns suggesting exactly that (although they are flawed as videos allegedly displaying residents burning down their own houses show the same man in multiply villages etc.).
