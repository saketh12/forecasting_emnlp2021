The SCA did not require the government to show probable cause or to obtain a warrant in order to obtain the data.\nIn April of 2011, police arrested four men in connection with a string of armed robberies of stores in and around Detroit, Michigan. The stores were Radio Shacks and T-Mobile stores. During police questioning, one of the suspects confessed that the group had committed robberies of nine stores in Michigan and Ohio over a four-month period from December of 2010 to March of 2011. During these robberies, the suspect informed police than an additional 15 men, alternating across robberies, served in various support capacities such as serving as police lookouts and as getaway drivers. The suspect forfeited his cell phone to FBI authorities, who examined the phone's call records for additional information. In May and June of 2011, the FBI applied for three different judicial orders in order to obtain transactional records for 16 different phone numbers gleaned from the suspect's phone. The evidence the FBI sought was for records that \"included '[a]ll subscriber information, toll records and call detail records including listed and unlisted numbers dialed or otherwise transmitted to and from [the] target telephones from December 1, 2010 to present[,]' as well as 'cell site information for the target telephones at call origination and at call termination for incoming and outgoing calls[.]'\" The orders were granted pursuant to the Stored Communications Act (hereafter, SCA). Under the SCA, the government can mandate the disclosure of certain telephone or telecommuncations records if \"specific and articulable facts show[] that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the contents of a wire or electronic communication, or the records or other information sought, are relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation.\u201d Prior to a federal trial on various charges, the petitioners, Timothy Ivory Carpenter and Timothy Michael Sanders, moved to suppress the evidence obtained by police under the SCA-authorized judicial orders. The petitioners alleged that the cellphone records could only be obtained via a warrant issued by a judge and supported by a showing of probable cause. The trial judge, Judge Sean Cox of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, denied the motion.[7]"], [37580, "2017-11-29T20:58:42Z", 0.65, "Several of the court members appear to be moving in this direction.
