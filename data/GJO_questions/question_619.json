If you know the set up and what is going on there, there will be no such campaign. There might be killings by troops of civilians who are not happy with the outcome of what is happening with Mugabe in Zimbabwe at present, but the chances of people killed due to looting is a bigger possibility.The reason for aforesaid is because Zimbabwe citizen are poor and all are hoping for a better outcome and life than what they had up to now. They waited for 37 years to do something to get rid of Mugabe because everybody was scared of the military who killed any person who was against Mugabe and because the military was manipulated by Mugabe. It took 37 years for one person in the military to stand up and do something.\nThe outcome of what is happening in Zimbabwe won't be the end of what happens in other African countries. These people of Africa always look what others do and eventually try to do the same.
