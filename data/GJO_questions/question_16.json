I can;t see why the new book would do spectacularly better.\nGJP audience: I don't see a huge audience among the GJP participants. If 20,000 took part in GJP, about half hardly participated (based on my 10-person group sample). Of the others, I doubt more than 15% will actually buy the book. And, many of those are probably the type who will put it on their list and get to it, as part of their reading.\nFinally, the subject-matter is a step removed from being personally actionable.

The GJP and Tetlock have been getting media coverage over the last few years and are probably well known by now among people interested in the subject.
