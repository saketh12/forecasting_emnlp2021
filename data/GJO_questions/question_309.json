With the size of the Russian presence in and around Syria a no-fly zone without the agreement of Russia would be very risky. At the moment I don't see Russia agreeing. I assume any no-fly zone would be to protect civilians in areas where not much fighting is taking place. Turkey has been interested in the area along its border with Syria. The West has been most concerned about the bombing in Aleppo, but by late January it could be too late to help with a no-fly zone there. The US public would not want to create a no-fly zone over IS territory. Russia would resist one being set up in north-west Syria. So the only likely areas would be over territory controlled by Turkey (which Turkey could do itself) or over territory controlled by the Kurds, which could set Turkey and the US at odds. So I think it unlikely to happen. "], [19725, "2016-11-04T22:54:12Z", 0.05, "The game is different, ow we are far from announcing anything, even if in facts it might be similar.
