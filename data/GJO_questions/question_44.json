To answer this question, I broke it down into more specific ones\u2014S in CHAMPS KNOW (select the right questions to answer and forecasts to make). Since the owners decide on his employment status, I asked two specific questions relevant to them: has Goodell made money for the owners, and have any new scandals arisen in the recent playoffs or thereafter? On the first question, as commissioner Goodell has brought in billions for the league through massive TV contracts and successful promotion of the NFL. Success in this respect is perhaps most important to owners, as the league is a business for them. On the second question, the NFL seems to have had a good season avoiding scandals, and since the Super Bowl, no new information about potential NFL-wide scandals has arisen that would lead to Goodell\u2019s firing. With both of these questions answered confidently (based on available information), there seems to be a 97% chance Goodell will be brought back in 2016. Nevertheless, W from CHAMPS KNOW (wildcards, accidents, and black swans can catch you if you don\u2019t consider the risk of irreducible uncertainty) encouraged me to be more careful in my judgment.

Tagliabue is widely believed to be one of the best NFL commissioners the league has seen. During his tenure, there was never a single player lockout or strike, and he took the league to new heights through his strategic TV deals and publicity campaigns. Goodell, however, has had a much more controversial history as commissioner and is not heavily favored by many of his peers in addition to NFL players and fans. \nH There has yet to be a commissioner in history that has had his contract terminated, and that fact will most likely not change with Goodell. His secure contract along with extensive support from various NFL owners will help keep his job safe. \nA There has been no news or headlines to change the last forecast regarding Goodell\u2019s job security, and it appears to be a near certainty that he will be commissioner next season. In addition, the 2016 season is officially over, and there will be little activity within the NFL until the next season, so Goodell will have little involvement and thus little room to make any controversial decisions. \nM Considering recent polls and surveys regarding Goodell, it is clearly that he is not extensively \u201cliked\u201d within the greater football community, however no models or statistics have shown that his tenure as NFL commissioner is anywhere near over in the years to come. \nP It becomes difficult to make a post-mortem analyses given the fact that the 2016 season has not started, however recent data indicates that he will indeed be the commissioner for the upcoming season. \nS Questions to consider are: How will Goodell respond to ongoing lawsuits with head trauma from former players? How will he respond in the future in terms of league policies and player misconduct? These are driving questions that pertain to how Goodell will be perceived by the public. \nK The key players that may influence Goodell\u2019s job security are himself, the players, and NFL owners. \nN Goodell can consider his job security safe unless he is found to violate the integrity of the NFL, which is the only grounds on which he can be voted out of the NFL. Such integrity came into question with the Ray Rice scandal, however since then a similar event has not resurfaced. \nO Another perspective to take into account is that of NFL owners. Take for example, Robert Kraft of the Patriots. The two have been accused of having mutually beneficial relationships in which Goodell lets Kraft cheat while Kraft ensures that Goodell keeps his job amid all of the controversy. \nW A potential wildcard could be a player misconduct issue that arises before the 2016 season that Goodell handles extremely poorly.

Some of the reasons include 1.) Despite owner Robert Craft of the New England patriots calling Goodell out and scrutinizing his decision to uphold Tom Brady's suspension and their forfeiture of draft picks, Goodell has the backing of a majority of the owners in the league, and many of the most powerful as well such as Jerry Jones, Jeffrie Lurie and the Rams owner Stan Kroenke, who is among the richest owners in the league and is moving his franchise to LA next year. It is also important to note that Goodell took a backseat in the debate over which franchise would move to LA next year. It was a heated debate and Goodell chose to take a backseat to ensure that he wouldnt waste any of his political capital (which he has lost alot of in recent years) by choosing one side over another. However, there are some other factors which need to be considered that could change this forecast if they occurred. Some factors that could alter this prediction and give Goodell less of a chance to be commissioner next year would be 1) how he handles the Johnny Manziel discipline situation. 2) How his appeal of Tom Brady's deflategate case decision plays out 3) if any other major discipline issues arise which he handles in a way that is not met favorable by the public. However, I believe that the chances of these potential factors playing much of a role in if he is commissioner next year are very small and will not make much of a difference. Historically, there has been six commissioners in NFL history and they average reign has been about 13 years, and amny of the shorter terms came in the early days of the league, skewing this data's average to be a little smaller than we would expect. As a result, I would expect Roger Godell to have a 99% chance of being the commissioner next year, mostly due to the fact that he has the backing by a majority of the most powerful owners.
