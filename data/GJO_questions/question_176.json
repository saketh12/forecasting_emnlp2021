Besides the fact that Batman v Superman was a tired pony from the start of the race as far as movie drum-up i.e., a lame opening weekend ticket gross domestically in the United States, Marvel just has bigger plans than the boys across the aisle. Marvel's film will exceed DC's opening weekend gross and it's thanks to the lads in the writer's room. This film has a very mediated tone potentially leading in many directions. Bucky Barnes, who is being pursued for his brain-washed actions in Captain America: Winter Soldier, takes on a number of Avengers, including Iron Man and Black Widow. This is a turning-point scene, as Bucky unloads a bullet from point-blank range at Tony Stark (Iron Man). This is a clear warning to the playboy genius that it's now a blood sport and there is no turning back. This scene is revealing a very provocative storyline future to come and if the whole film is on this level it will exceed well over $166,007,347 domestic which was the total gross for Batman v Superman in it's opening weekend. Furthermore, the DC Comic film's domestic gross was only 37.5% of its total lifetime gross. I cannot wait to see what this sequence throws into motion. One year after the events of Avengers: Age of Ultron, another incident occurs involving the Avengers resulting in collateral damage, enticing politicians to voice the need for closer management of such beings. And form a system of accountability and a governing body to determine when the Avengers are needed. When Steve Rogers (Captain America) attempts to protect Barnes and ends up in a conflict with Stark. The Avengers divide into two opposing leagues\u00e2\u20ac\u201done led by Captain America, who wishes to operate without convoluting regulation, and the other by Iron Man, who can sees value in government sovereignty over the team. \n\n    This film becomes quite poetic once you begin to sense the euphemism for modern American political differences beneath the storyline's suggestive current. Captain America portraying the conservative struggle for a free and wholesome life and Iron Man resembling the liberal willingness to submit to government protection and equal benefit for all. This theme seems to paint the walls and canvases of Marvel's \"Civil War\" empire.
