Looking back as the GJO consensus trend, a week ago the consensus was 56%, but I don't see any great change in the polls between last week and this, so why has the GJO consensus changed so much? \nI was in Spain last week, but not in Catalonia and could not help but notice the majority view of the rest of Spain, that regards the Catalan independence as somewhere between madness and irritation (my local restaurant has jokingly renamed Crema Catalan on its menu, Crema Valencian). I suspect that the views of my Spanish friends has biased my view of this vote, I think that Catalan Independence would be a crazy complicated outcome. (How many boarder crossings and customs post would be needed?) So I tend to assume that sensible voters would not actually vote for parties that seem to promote chaos, but I have been caught out too many times in the last couple of years by voters who seem to be totally irrational and have voted for people, parties or ideas that have zero chance of achieving the golden future promised to their supporters. \nHaving said that I do suspect that in Catalonia sensible people who want a quiet life are keeping a low profile and would be less likely to tell pollsters they are going to vote for the boring sensible parties and not the exciting, brave independence parties, so I am going for a slightly higher chance of a No than a Yes. \n "], [41270, "2017-12-18T22:47:30Z", 0.3, "Seems they may fall a bit short, but it's going to be really close."], [636, "2017-12-18T19:19:05Z", 0.75, "They already approved separation and are incensed by the Spanish government's heavy handed policies towards the leaders of the separatist movement."], [31275, "2017-12-18T15:03:30Z", 0.4, "Close call.
