The last politieke barometer as a prediction was at 19.1.2017 (http://www.ipsos-nederland.nl/ipsos-politieke-barometer/barometer-van-deze-week). So I start with this numbers: currently there is no coalition between three parties possible, because they need 76 seats in the \"Tweede Kammer\" and the best coalition would only get 72 (VVD, PVV, CDA or VVD, PVV, D66).\nThen there are 19 possible coalition between 4 parties. All of them need participation of VVD and PVV. Currently they would both get 27 seats so even if they come together Wilders would not become PM. Beside this the current PM Rutte said that the chance of a coworking between PVV and VVD would be 0% (http://nos.nl/artikel/2153087-rutte-kans-op-regering-vvd-met-pvv-is-nul.html). \nThere are also 24 coalitions between five parties possible. 14 of them would be also lead by VVD but that mean there are also 10 under lead of PVV. 4 of this are together with PvdA and they do not want to work together with PVV (http://nos.nl/artikel/2152980-pvda-voorzitter-spekman-henk-en-mark-zeg-nee-tegen-de-pvv.html). Remain 6 under lead of PVV but they also all need CDA as a partner and they made bad experience with PVV in cabinet Rutte one from 2010 till 2012. And also one of the politicians from CDA said, that he would will go, if they work together (http://www.omroepbrabant.nl/?news/2548851263/CDAer+Ren%C3%A9+Peters+uit+Oss+samenwerken+met+PVV+uitgesloten.aspx).

I think coalitions with 6 parties are not able to work together.\nSo I get 5 of 43 coalitions that would be lead by PM Wilders mean 11,6% possibility. From there on I would correct at may to 13% because there is also the possibility  that 6 parties work together. And then I get my numbers out of a prediction and there are still two months to go to the election, so maybe PVV is getting more seats than VVD what would change my model again.

The most suitable partner - VVD - has declared it won't make a coalition with Wilders and is losing many seats compared to 2012. He stands at best a chance of just over 2% of forming a government - alone or in a two-way coalition. As all parties refuse to govern with him and the Dutch electoral system represents many smaller parties, the odds of him forming a coalition with more than one party are smaller the more parties would need to be involved. Thus I would reduce it to 1.5%. But the fact that if he were to get a coalition organised, the PVV would most likely be the major partner and therefore win the position of prime minister. That makes me raise it to 2% again. It is also interesting that the PVV's performance has not improved since the Berlin attack, which makes me doubt whether a renewed terrorist attack would help raise the PVV's seat share considerably.
