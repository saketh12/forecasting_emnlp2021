Just before the two leaders sat down to dine on steak, Trump authorised a major unilateral use of force, with the US military firing 59 cruise missiles against a Syrian military airfield in retaliation for President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s use of chemical weapons against civilians days earlier.\nWhen Trump informed Xi of the strike later in the evening, the subtext was likely laid on so thick that Xi could have cut it with his steak knife: the United States remains a superpower and the only country both capable and willing of this sort of unilateral action. Tellingly, the Chinese Foreign Ministry, while noting the strike, did not offer outright condemnation.\nIf this wasn\u2019t a moment of humiliation for Xi with nationalistic audiences back home looking for signs of strength against a US leader who had been vocal about pushing back against China, it was at least a moment of forced weakness.\nAs Xi told Trump as they sat down to dine, China saw \u201ca thousand reasons to make the China-US relationship work; [there is] no reason to break it\u201d. We have little evidence that the Trump administration planned the authorisation of the Syria strike to coincide with the summit or to send China any particular message, but the timing was an uncanny reminder for Beijing of the differences that remain between the US and China; that the two remain near-peers in the realm of contemporary great powers, and not absolute peers as China would will it.\nWhat\u2019s more, the strike all but bumped what should have been a major moment in US-China relations to below-the-fold as global media immediately seized on the Trump administration\u2019s dalliance with unilateralism in the Middle East. Indeed, just as unexpected conflagrations in the region stemming from the Arab Uprisings drew attention away from the Obama administration\u2019s \u201crebalance\u201d to Asia, so did Trump\u2019s Syria strikes depress the significance of the Mar-a-Lago meeting.\nEven if unintentional, Xi may have drawn important lessons from Trump\u2019s decision on Thursday evening to authorise strikes on Syria. The decision represented both a capricious reversal in policy and a dangerously impulsive willingness to escalate. For China, whose foreign policy bureaucracy continues to wrangle with the overall direction of Trump\u2019s foreign policy amid mixed signals, factoring these tendencies in US decision-making on the North Korean problem and the South China Sea will be a necessity.\""], [13377, "2017-04-08T13:19:28Z", 0.0, "Xi, Trump best buddies now. https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/apr/08/trump-to-visit-china-as-beijing-touts-new-era-of-ties-with-us"], [34832, "2017-04-07T18:47:00Z", 0.15, "With the new, more assertive american government it is unlikely China will make this move, especially if they want to maintain president Trump on their good side."], [9842, "2017-04-04T01:15:38Z", 0.25, "surprised they haven't done so already"], [34675, "2017-04-03T17:37:36Z", 0.25, "Yes China has the right to set up and declare an air defense identification zone"], [34675, "2017-04-03T17:34:31Z", 0.25, "Yes China has a right to set up"], [34716, "2017-04-03T10:57:47Z", 0.35, "it\u2019s a subject for US \u2013Chains power demonstration mainly in Far East & Japan sea related issues- which we witnessing currently  "], [34699, "2017-04-03T04:39:09Z", 0.0, "They may declare it way after August, but not before.
