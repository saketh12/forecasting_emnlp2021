That link isn\u2019t working for me at the moment, but I can see the following information from the page: \u201cMore than 330 WWII monuments to Red Army vanished in Poland in last 20 years, envoy says...Twenty years ago, more than 560 World War II monuments to the Red Army were located on Poland's territory outside burial...\u201d Assuming that number is accurate, that\u2019s 1.37 monuments removed per month. I can\u2019t find good background information regarding the timing of those removals, but I think it\u2019s as safe to assume that they came down in batches as it is to assume that they came down at a steady rate. Still, in lieu of better information, this is the best baseline we seem to have.\nIn terms of more recent (and documented) cases: At least one \u201cSoviet monument was removed from the town of Pieniezno\u201d in 2015  and a mausoleum in Trzcianka was knocked down in September 2017 , despite the protests of the Russian MFA. In the case of Pieniezno, Russia threatened Poland with \u201cmost serious consequences.\u201d  The city went ahead with the removal anyway. So we know that removals have happened recently and that they\u2019ve happened over the strenuous objection of the Russians. Cities and provinces weren\u2019t waiting for federal legislation to pull down monuments. But was that the low-hanging fruit, perhaps? Are many of the remaining monuments in more pro-Russia areas? It doesn\u2019t seem that we have the data to really make that determination, unfortunately. There are around 500 standing  and about half that number have been targeted for removal by this order .\nPer the RFE story footnoted below, \u201cA 2007 poll\u2026showed around 57 percent of respondents were against the removal of Soviet monuments. But Polish attitudes toward Moscow have hardened significantly since Russia's 2014 annexation of\u2026the Crimean Peninsula.\u201d This information is only slightly useful. Ideally, we\u2019d have more recent results, with some sense of the geographic distribution of anti-Soviet monument sentiment.\nThe articles footnoted below say \u201cit is up to city councils whether they want them (the monuments) cleared, but an official in Warsaw\u2019s city council said that while they had no plans to remove their (in Warsaw) Soviet monuments, the provincial authorities, which are more closely aligned to Poland\u2019s governing party, can overrule their decision.\u201d Multiple layers of red tape make it tougher to know what to make of strong sentiments from any one policymaker.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that at least one demolition took eight months  from decision to removal, so while it\u2019s not clear that we\u2019d have any warning that a municipality had made a decision to remove, it seems to me that the Russians would be crowing about it well in advance. Perhaps this long lead time is a one off, I can\u2019t be sure without a better archive.\nIn summary: There are a lot of question marks here. I can only find recent news coverage of about one removal per year, but that\u2019s well off the historic average. I think it\u2019s safe to assume for these purposes that the law was passed with the intention of spurring more removals, though it could have been a primarily symbolic gesture. Given the lack of clarity around the issue, I\u2019m starting in the 40-60 range and adjusting down incrementally until the end of the prediction period. Given there are no current (English-language) stories about impending removals, and that previous removals have taken quite some time to come to completion, I\u2019ll start at 40% and adjust downward. There are 57 days to resolution, so I\u2019ll take a percentage point off every day between now and then and keep an eye on the headlines, adjusting upwards if there are rumblings of a specific removal."], [41084, "2017-11-01T07:32:37Z", 0.7, "the linked BBC article is leading me to that forecast."], [32258, "2017-10-31T16:25:53Z", 0.05, "@Dsarin makes a good case"], [23779, "2017-10-31T13:26:53Z", 0.8, "lowering because of time passed.
