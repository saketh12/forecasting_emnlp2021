The most violent and unstable areas in Africa are just to the East of both nations, and the DRC is a popular destination for war refugees.  The median age of men and women is about 18 years old and life expectancy is around 55 years of age for both sexes.  As we know from insurance rates, males age 18-24 are very likely to engage in high risk behavior.  Tribalism is the governing force of the nation and dehumanization and genocide have happened in the DRC in the recent past.  In my opinion, most precursors for genocide exist in the DRC.  I predict an armed group from within the DRC will systematically kill 1,000 or more civilians within the DRC before April 1, 2018.
