Firstly, it's just one analysis of the situation from a firm with a track record that I can't find out. The analysis also seems to be focused on the 6S' sales, and reading over my previous forecast, I read how with the 6 now being $100 cheaper, sales growth won't just come from the 6S. \nMore importantly with the analysis, there wasn't as much detail as I'd have liked. Assuming that the excerpts which have been published in articles like this (http://www.businessinsider.com.au/iphone-6s-sales-disappointing-pacific-crest-2015-10), which have been mentioned by quite a few others before me, are all that he's said on this topic and is all the detail that he goes into, then it has to be questioned what Apple's initial \"component orders\" or \"expectations\" were. It's all relative; so if Apple's initial expectations and component orders were for iPhone sales of say 80m, then below expectations or \"disappointing sales\" might not mean sales will fall below 75m. His sources might have been similarly vague about describing sales. How does he calculate an estimate of 67m units?\nIn terms of what he says about fewer stores selling out of iPhones, as I recall, last year's iPhone release had supply issues considering demand beat expectations (quick search gives 71.5m) and also issues with manufacturing the 6 Plus' larger screen.\nOn the final point, that \u201calmost all carriers surveyed indicated that iPhone 6s sales were down y/y, compared to the iPhone 6.\u201d, I'm assuming he's referring to US carriers.
