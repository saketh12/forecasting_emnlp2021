Such a step , which must surely be based upon detailed intelligence, might usually be delivered behind the scenes through diplomatic channels.\nThe use of chemical weapons requires tell-tale preparations such as the movement of particular units, the distribution of weapons to a base from which they can be delivered and so on, all capable of being picked up by US satellites or drones.\nThe warning is clearly intended to forestall such an attack and to make it clear that if the Syrian regime again crosses this line - just as it did last April - the US will respond with force.\nThis time though the context is very different.
