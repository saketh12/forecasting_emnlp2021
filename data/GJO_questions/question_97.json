In an unusual joint statement Friday, the Department of Homeland Security and Director of National Intelligence said that \u201cthe U.S. Intelligence Community (USIC) is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions, including from US political organizations.\u201d\nThe U.S. spooks added that \u201cthe Russians have used similar tactics and techniques across Europe and Eurasia,\u201d and that given the \u201cscope and sensitivity\u201d of these efforts \u201conly Russia\u2019s senior-most officials could have authorized these activities.\u201d Senior-most is a euphemism for Mr. Putin.\nOne question is why the Obama Administration has gone public with this hacking news now.

For example, as with the Russian reverse-sanction-sanction of banning importation of food categories from selected countries. Would a ban in the United States on the importation of any rug made in Iran be a sanction on Iran or the carpet-makers? Provided the ban is universal (\"all carpets from X\") I think we could say it was a sanction against X, not just the carpet-makers. So, what universal-type bans would be an appropriate response for a cyber-attack? There's also a difference between export and import bans. They may have comparable symbolism, but export bans are more difficult to enforce. Further, there is also consideration of the specific nature of the economic trade existing between the two relevant nations. Sanctions on the importation of product A from country X might be quite strong, if the export of product A by country X is meaningful. So, in particular circumstances, tying matchsticks or coconuts to cyber-attacks might not be far-fetched at all. Bans on imports also usually incur some cost to the importer. So sanctions, via bans, are a rich area with a lot of flexibility ranging over symbolism to economic effects. If cyber warfare continues as it has, no doubt such cyber-sanctions are to follow. Perhaps there is a joint NSA, Treasury, State department working group within the U.S. actively developing a framework for these now.

Russia, with it's military re-emergence alone is not to be trifled-with by the Western bloc. Add Putin's unpredictability, economic credentials and apparent favour with the Russian public and we see he is not going anywhere anytime soon and continues to build national pride and international fear in his re-militarisation of the nation.
