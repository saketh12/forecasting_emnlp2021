Further analysis reveals that politically motivated conflicts (28%), land ownership disputes (24%), religious conflicts (23%) and farmer & pastoralist conflicts (22%) are amongst common causes of conflicts across Nigerian communities.

Since Boko Haram showed up on the radar as a legitimate terrorist organization, it has yet to carry out the systematic killing of 1,000 or more people in one incident.  The Nigerian Army and the UN are having military success against Boko Haram, as well.  I predict no armed group will systematically kill 1,000 or more people in Nigeria between April 1, 2017 - March 31, 2018.  Boko Haram seems to be following the ISIS abroad tactic of small scale terrorist attacks as their main means of combat.  The major risk area I see is the borderlands and the presence of Boko Haram in other countries leaking into less secure regions of Nigeria.
