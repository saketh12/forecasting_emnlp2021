They're predicting the shortages will continue even though the country is beginning it's 2nd harvest season and that these shortages will increase the risk of cholera, estimating that many level 3 areas will turn to level 4 areas by Oct-Jan.  Their current status puts Yemen \"at risk of famine\" and a headline with that warning was issued in their Food Security Outlook report in March.  That report period runs from February-September.  90% of Yemen's food supply comes from food imports & the country remains under blockade from land and water (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemeni_Civil_War_(2015%E2%80%93present)). \n This region is predicted to remain at risk, and news indicates that Saudi barricades and delays for humanitarian aid are ongoing and may continue, that 40% of hospitals are down or limited in what they can do to help.  Based on FEWS Net reporting history, a follow up Food Security Report for the Oct-Jan period is typical for at-risk areas.  Historically, October reports for in areas immediately post-harvest tend to be more positive and less dire sounding about risks than the Feb-April status reports.  Unless the situation worsens and the risk of famine increases for Yemen specifically to merit its own report or for the general region of northeast Africa, the headline will probably not include the word \"famine\" and \"Yemen\" specifically and other terms to return focus to level 3 or 4 risk will be used.  However, if predicted combinations of medical and food shortages continue and worsen, or if the threat of level 5 food shortage increases for the Oct-Feb period, a headline with both \"Yemen\" and \"famine is probable..
