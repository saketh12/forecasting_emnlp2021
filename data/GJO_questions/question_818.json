I think China's massive investment in this area and expansion of military exercises, trials of new military equipment, claims of threats from others, and military bases off the coast of the Philippines in the Spratly Islands, among other things, make it clear that they intend very much to claim and eventually enforce exclusive rights in this area.  And while I think Vietnam and Philippines can do very little on their own about this, I think the US and UK are continuing to move through the area in their \"normal\" way but on heightened alert to show that they don't plan to let China claim exclusive rights.  The fact that China is making a big deal about the \"provocation\" of a UK warship getting too close to the Paracel Islands, that they sent military vehicles to warn them off, suggests that China wants to continue to clearly stake to their claim but not yet actually enforce it.  The fact that the UK vessel was careful to stay exactly 12 nautical miles from the Island group in strict observation of an internationally recognized territorial limitation suggests that they are purposefully rejecting China's claims.  And will continue to do so.  And I think China will continue to expand their military, and in fact, this theater of aggression gives China the opportunity of openly expanding and exploring naval military development without unusual scrutiny (or at least any more than military agencies of various nations would otherwise give).  I think there is little likelihood for the time being of any slip up unless it comes from Vietnam or Philippines, and even then very small.  But eventually there will be some excuse of international political threat which will justify China's enforcement of their claims, and after having made them for years it will no doubt seem much more reasonable (to China and its allies) and justify warning shots.  And I imagine that the US and UK and others will then stand down rather than engage in direct confrontation unless there is some direct declaration of war already at hand.

Frankly a military show of force is a much better use of money than actual use of force.  However, I think there are still areas where confrontation is a real possibility.  Military exercises and aggression from personnel on ships is not unknown and although probably formally forbidden, may still result in an unexpected skirmish (maybe it's just my opinion about the fanatical culture within Chinese military, esp those patrolling the Pacific coasts).  There may be some issues over Taiwan as well, as this is a timely moment for China to enforce what they've long wanted to - now they have the economic leverage and are less likely to hedge about their political control in public/media to countries traditionally thinking poorly of Communism or China's uses of power.  On the other hand, Taiwan has few real allies left and none who could really off them real military support.  Plenty of neighboring countries might wish to depress China's growing power or expansion but they'll surely rely as much on diplomacy as possible and appease what they can rather than oppose or confront, and possibly Taiwan is probably already past the point of fighting for - a symbolic loss that we've long expected.  Pretty likely something will happen in the next 3 years, but probably not very likely it will happen this year.   US ships may be the biggest wild card - we're much more likely that others to be aggressive in a confrontation that results in a skirmish, though I think both US military officials and Chinese govt. officials probably really to avoid that at this point: too early for China and too risky for US (or Britain or Australia, etc).

Initially, before conducting any research, I assigned a much lower probability of this event happening, but the likelihood of a lethal confrontation is much greater than previously expected.  The Council on Foreign Relations argues that the territorial dispute over 8 islands between China and Japan, which is critical to U.S. interests, has escalated in the recent months.  Chinese vessels have increased incursions into the disputed waters and due to this, Japan has increased its military capabilities, such as radar and missile systems, which led to the same actions by China in response.  China has built large naval warships to guard its vessels to maintain strategic advantage, which has presented serious concerns to Japan.  Consequently, Chinese aircraft have approached Japan\u2019s airspace over 570 times, which has caused the Japanese military to scramble its jets 199 times as a response.  Although these events are concerning, it is pertinent to many major powers, including the United States, that no lethal confrontation takes place, which would undoubtedly cause additional casualties between the two historical enemies.  Both countries stand on completely inverse ideological and political spectrums, which may or may not influence future confrontations.
