Also, the US has 5 of the top 10 Jewish populated cities in the world and the majority of Jews are Zionists.  The Zionist lobby is very strong in Washington.  President Trump has tasked Jared Kushner with solving the problem.  Unless Israel grows new land or Egypt is willing to change its borders, the Palestinians and Jews in Israel will stay in a constant state of unrest that causes regular violence.  In my opinion, rather than assigning anyone with the task of solving the problem, we leave Israel alone and occasionally scold them when their human rights abuses become too egregious.
