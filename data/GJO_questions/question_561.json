Marawi is something of an embarrassment to Duterte who originally claimed it would be over in a few weeks as he continued his focus on the drug war, killing his own people.

Along with the casualties, much of Marawi was flattened in what was described as the heaviest urban fighting in the Philippines since World War II.\n----------------\nWas it an overreaction for Duterte to impose martial law beyond Marawi to the whole island? His comments focused on the need to make sure the terrorism doesn't spread and that it's temporary. Then it was extended to the end of the year and some of his supporters indicated they would support keeping it in place until the end of his term in 2022.\nHe initially downplayed the existence of terrorism in the country as he fought his war on drugs aimed at his own people.\nWould imposing martial law on the rest of the country show that he's losing the war on terrorism and it's spreading? Or is martial law just what he wants anyway? I'm not sure.

If the US weren't so invested in the island state, I would forecast nationwide martial law as highly probably. A nearly $100 million dollar military aid package, among other US aid packages, would be at risk with nationwide martial law.  There are strings attached to US aid packages, and I believe the creation of a dictatorship would cut the strings.    "]]}
