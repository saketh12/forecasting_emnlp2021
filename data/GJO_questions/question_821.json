The family has infiltrated the government for a very longtime and rules with an iron fist. Although the countries constitutions reads like a democracy, it is run like a police state. A police state that has been run by the same family for decades. Bashar, like his father, uses secret police and military action to maintain dominance throughout the country. The question becomes, who will remove Bashar al-Assad from power? Currently, ISIS was a grave threat to Syria, but with the global effort to eliminate ISIS, it appears that their stronghold in the region has all but evaporated. The other factions within Syria that oppose al-Assad's government are being suppressed by pro-Syrian Russian forces that bring strong military backing. And recently Rex Tillerson has indicated, along with Trump, that Assad is no longer a threat that is a top priority to the US and that the Syrian people control Assad's fate. Understanding that the power Assad holds over the Syrian government, it is hard to fathom that the Syrian people have much control over Assad's fate and will over throw the dictator. Assad effectively has the power of Russia behind him.  Mr. Edrogan, the President of Turkey, outwardly objects to Assad's continued reign of power in Syria.
