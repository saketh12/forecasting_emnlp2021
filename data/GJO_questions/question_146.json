I'm frankly not convinced whether the continued uncertainty over the wars in Yemen and Syria may lead Saudi to double down or reverse its economic war against Iran through maintaining low oil prices. Therefore, for my initial forecast, I thought I'd start on the demand side. As a starting point I plotted daily Brent prices from FRED going back to 1989 and compared them to the dates of US recessions. While the data set is very limited, the average decline from peak to trough in Brent prices in the run-up and through a US recession is 60%. Using the Dec 2013 price level as the peak, Brent's recent sub-USD30 low reflects a 77% decline (slightly worse than the fall from July-December 2008). For prices to fall below USD20, this would imply ~83% decline from the Dec 2013 peak, which looking at strictly in terms of energy prices, would imply a slightly worse financial crisis than the GFC. Uncertainty over China's shift to lower-rate growth amid the rebalancing of its economy from investment to consumption-driven growth, makes that kind of scenario slightly more likely. I do think that if we get down to USD20 a barrel, a sharp rebound would be likely either by sparking a reversal in Saudi-led policy or a geopolitical risk spike triggered by a crisis of confidence in the ability of Saudi to maintain economic stability amid sustained pressure on its reserves. I'm putting the probability at 20% as my initial forecast. A weekly close above USD40 would lead me to drop this down sharply to 10%. If next week's close continues to stay above 35, I'd likely reduce more gradually towards 15%. A weekly close below USD30 would lead me to raise gradually toward 25%, and a close below USD25 would lead me to raise sharply to 40%+."], [20638, "2016-02-26T10:37:36Z", 0.1, "saudis cut production"], [6303, "2016-02-26T04:27:49Z", 0.02, "Brent crude oil prices are maintaining above $30 per barrel, but there is talk about further price drops and bankruptcies of the smaller fracking oil and gas companies in Texas.
