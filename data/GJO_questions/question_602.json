This may be a topic of discussion in the margins of the UNGA, among African and non-African nations, and in the absence of any specific information on the discussion I estimate a 25% chance that the AU will request China's involvement soon after the end of the UNGA, with a 50% chance that it will be followed by UN authorization and agreement by Djibouti and Eritrea by the end of the year. That makes a 12.5% chance overall. I add to that a 5% chance that violence will break out on the border and the decision will be expedited. Rounding off, that makes 18%.

China has presented the facility as a support base to run anti-piracy operations in waters along Africa\u2019s east coast as well as peacekeeping and humanitarian missions in the region. China's state news agency Xinhua  did not disclose how many military personnel would be stationed at the facility or when it would become fully operational. But previous mainland reports have put the size of the deployment at 10,000. The lease runs for a decade with China paying US$20 million a year. But given it sits at the shipping choke point of the Gulf of Aden which opens to the Suez Canal and beyond, China\u2019s regional neighbors including Japan, India and Vietnam were likely to view the deployment with alarm, mainland experts said. Djibouti already hosts several foreign military bases, including one each from the US and Japan, two strategic rivals to Beijing. A base by Saudi Arabia is also under construction in Djibouti. My thinking is based on the report that at least 10,000 Chinese troops will be sent to support the new naval base compared to the 4,000 U. S. troops at its base. Sending in even more Chinese troops would fit into President Xi Jinping's expansion desires plus give China better control of the Bab al-Mandab Strait. From China's perspective, It makes sense to have more troops there.
