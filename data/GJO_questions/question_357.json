This leaves us with only April through June for the parliament to discuss Article 50 and how to best go about \"Brexiting\". Just as a little kicker for that short amount of time for the Parliament to discuss this complex topic, assuming they have roughly the same amount of days off as they did for last year (ref: http://www.parliament.uk/about/faqs/house-of-commons-faqs/business-faq-page/recess-dates/) they will be on vacation for roughly 41 of the 91 days of April through June. If PM May thinks that the Parliament can push through a complex and VERY emotionally charged and controversial Article in a Parliament that is not a very heavy majority for any party (ref: http://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/lords/composition-of-the-lords/ and http://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/mps/current-state-of-the-parties/), then I would argue that she is either an eternal optimist or na\u00c3\u00afve, which I would suspect neither of her. Based on that I would think it will be very unlikely to see a call for an early general election before 1 July 2017. Another roadblock to this is that in order for a early general election to be called, according to the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 there needs to be either a vote of \"No confidence in Her Majesty's Government\" or there needs to a motion passed by 2/3 of the MPs (to include vacant seats). Mathematically, this would be quite difficult for the current majority party (the conservatives) because even if they could get EVERY vote except the Labor votes, they would still fall short of a 2/3 vote.
