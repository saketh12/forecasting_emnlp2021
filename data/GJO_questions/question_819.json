Truman, seven surface combatants and two submarines departed stateside for the region on April 11. They were scheduled to join a guided-missile cruiser, three guided-missile destroyers and a nuclear-powered attack submarine already in the Mediterranean to form a 15-ship-strong naval task force.\nIn addition, the USS Essex expeditionary strike group was slated to deploy to the area. Along with its escorts, the Essex would embark a squadron of Lockheed F-35B Lightning IIs, representing the long-awaited operational debut of the Joint Strike Fighter.\nWhile it may be the largest U.S. naval deployment to the region since the start of the Iraq war, much of the sea power involved in that conflict deployed to the Persian Gulf. Even in the 1991 Gulf War, which involved a larger force, the carriers operated from the Gulf and the Red Sea. In actuality, the largest American naval deployment to the Mediterranean occurred 36 years ago during a war that didn\u2019t directly involve the United States.\nOn June 6, 1982, Israel invaded Lebanon in response to an increasing number of provocations by the Palestinians. In some of the fiercest fighting of the modern era, the Israelis made quick of its adversaries, one of which was the military of Syria under the rule of Hafez Al Assad, father of current Syrian leader Bashar Al Assad. By June 14, Israel was laying siege to Beirut.\nAs Tel Aviv continued to place maximum pressure on the Lebanese capital, concerns arose in Washington and around the world of the possibility of the eruption of a larger regional war, mainly one drawing a deeper Syrian involvement. In response, the Reagan administration bolstered its presence in the region.\nThe nuclear-powered Nimitz-class supercarrier USS Dwight D. Eisenhower and her battle group, which was on-station in the Mediterranean when the war began, in early June had been joined by USS John F. Kennedy, which had entered the Mediterranean via the Suez Canal from the Indian Ocean. On June 24, Eisenhower assisted in the evacuation of American citizens in Lebanon caught up in the conflict.\nThe next day, two more carrier battle groups, centered on USS Forrestal and USS Independence joined Kennedy and Eisenhower from the United States. The result was a 50-ship task force, with four carriers and their air wings at the core, along with a plethora of other surface combatants. This powerful juggernaut was to conduct a NATO exercise codenamed \u201cDaily Double,\u201d but were also ordered to prepare for additional evacuations and, possibly, rescue attempts of other Americans still in Lebanon.\nThough the siege of Beirut would last until August, the situation had stabilized to Washington\u2019s satisfaction within several days. Exercise Daily Double concluded, and Forrestal and Independence relieved Kennedy and Eisenhower of duty, sending the latter two home.\nThis \u201cdream team\u201d lasted for only days, but it represented one of the greatest assemblies of air and naval power in the post-Vietnam War era. It was certainly the most powerful concentration of carrier-based air power ever in the Mediterranean. By comparison, two carrier battle groups were deployed to the Mediterranean for the Iraq invasion in 2003.\nBy 1982, the carrier and its embarked air wing had improved by leaps and bounds from just a decade earlier. Apart from Forrestal, which still carried the McDonnell Douglas F-4S Phantom II, all three carriers were equipped with the Grumman F-14A Tomcat as its primary fleet-defense fighter.\nBy then in its second decade of service, the Tomcat had already proven to be one of the world\u2019s deadliest dogfighters. Armed with one of the most powerful radars of its time and the long-range AIM-54 Phoenix missile, alongside shorter-range missiles and a gun, the Tomcat would prove time and again in the Middle East it was one of the region\u2019s \u201ctop guns.\u201d Just a year prior, two F-14s had downed two Libyan fighters over the Gulf of Sidra, an area not too far from the shores of Lebanon."], [25705, "2018-05-01T15:51:24Z", 0.0, "@Anneinak"], [43003, "2018-05-01T15:27:42Z", 0.65, "While there is a very high p() of US having killed Iranians during this time period, there is only a 50/50 chance it will be admitted by Iran while a 80% it will be admitted by US."], [172, "2018-05-01T12:00:30Z", 0.5, "Good background article on T4 base.\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/01/the-syrian-airbase-at-the-heart-of-a-potential-israel-iran-war"], [46762, "2018-04-30T19:01:59Z", 1.0, "According to pbs:  https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/missile-strikes-in-syria-kill-over-a-dozen-most-of-them-iranians"], [1056, "2018-04-30T18:43:19Z", 0.2, "The real question is, what does GJO mean by \"confrontation.\" It seems to me that for this to close as a \"yes,\" it means that if one side is shooting, the other side has to be shooting back.

The long standing issue that has divided both countries is Iran's nuclear program, which has resulted in sweeping sanctions placed on Iran from both the US and the EU. The sanctions have had a devastating effect on the economy. Inflation reached double digit numbers, food prices increased dramatically, and there is a growing divide between rich and poor. The government has struggled under sanctions, especially with the oil embargo, and was willing to reach out to the US for talks in 2013. The long negotiations that followed led to the Iran Deal, which is still in effect today. Although the Trump administration has referred to the Iran Deal, as the \"worst deal ever,\" he has received pressure from European allies to keep the the deal alive as their is no viable alternative. Despite Trump's seemingly decisive rhetoric, has offered sanctions relief and Congress is moving to address some of his concerns about the deal. However, with John Bolton becoming Trump's national security advisor and Mike Pompeo becoming head of the State Department, the Iran Deal is in limbo. Both are fierce critics of the deal, with Bolton arguing for air strikes against Iranian nuclear infrastructure. So far, however, there has not been a major shift in official tone and should it lead to airstrikes, it is likely that the US will consult European allies.

Would a lethal confrontation be a one-on-one military engagement directly between Iran and U.S.A, or can a lethal confrontation also entail proxy warfare? This is important to distinguish because if we are to operate under the assumption that proxy conflicts can be considered a lethal confrontation, then this has already happened. For instance, while U.S troops have killed pro-Assad Russian mercenaries, a U.S and Israel coalition also targeted Hezbollah forces in Syria after Israel captured an Iranian drone. However, taking it a step further, one can also make the case that Iran was indirectly targeted in this situation as well due to Hezbollah receiving training, weapons, and financial support from Iran (in other words, it was a U.S led coalition versus and Iranian one). \n          Despite a real possibility of a lethal confrontation occurring, I think there is only a 30% chance that it will happen due to each country being very wary of their situations in Syria. Moreover, I would put the percentage of a direct conflict any higher due to Russia's role in Syria. Russia at the moment has arguably played much more of an active role than Iran. Therefore, naturally that chances of a U.S lethal confrontation will be higher with whoever is heading the opposition.\nhttps://www.vox.com/world/2018/2/13/17008446/us-troops-syria-russia-mercenaries-killed\n"], [57092, "2018-03-27T16:13:47Z", 0.15, "Trump and administration more focused on North Korea..
