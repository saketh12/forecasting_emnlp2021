Yet, it is hard to see a Grexit happening without one of the following catalysts first taking place: \nDefault/treat of default: Interesting to see what happens here wrt expiry of program in March. There will probably be noise about this in Feb/Mar. \nNo new program: current program expires in March. The participants (except IMF) seem willing to renew. The parties could carry a program without the IMF, Germany wants IMF to participate-negotiation ploy. It is unclear how long Greece can last without any program. This is probably the most important catalyst as it leads to default and pressure on the banking system. Expect parties to avoid it or find a way to resolve it without an exit (e.g. trough haircut)   \nBreach of agreement on reforms: pension reform is a current source of tension and IMF doesn't want to participate in a new bailout unless there is debt relief (http://www.imf.org/external/np/tr/2016/tr011416.htm)\nFall of government: politics are unpredictable, especially in Greece \nElections: none scheduled in 2016 \nCivil unrest due to a worsening economy: no current indication of this. \n->To be watched: IMF review in January 2016.
