These included deregulating oversight regulations for preventing coal mining, oil and natural gas dumping and contaminating streams and river, and the repeal of a regulation that would have required energy companies to disclose their payments to foreign governments.  The latter repeals a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rule written under the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law meant to fight corruption in resource-rich countries by mandating that companies on United States stock exchanges disclose the royalties and other payments that oil, natural gas, coal and mineral companies make to governments.

The UN is NOT any kind of \"world government\" and does not have any authority over its members except as they have allowed by signing and ratifying treaties.  When the UN attempts to exert influence that is clearly biased or against our national interests, then we, the United States, are under no obligation to follow those programs.

With respect to climate change, the United States has done more to save and restore Earth's environment than China, Russia, India, and the great majority of the other member nations of the UN.  Yet the United States and the other Western democracies are supposed to take environmental measures that will cost them an enormous amount of money while China, India and Russia continue to pollute the air and water on a massive scale.   And, we're also supposed to pay a hugely disproportionate share of the overall costs of the UN, which takes every chance they can to criticize and condemn the U.S. and its allies.
