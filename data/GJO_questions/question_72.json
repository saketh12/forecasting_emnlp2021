It looks like IAEA believes the Iranians are complying with the requirements and predict the criteria (e.g. centrifuges) will be met by the end of December.   It appears there are two items that are still under review: Possible Military Dimensions -PMD is pending but suspect some way will be found to meet that requirement.   The other item is compliance with \"additional protocol and \"implementation of modified code 3.1.\"   This refers to transparency and access to sites for IAEA inspections.   On page 5, item 18 on the IAEA document there is a statement that says: \n \"On 18 October 2015, the Director General received a letter from the Permanent Representative of Iran to the Agency informing the Agency pursuant to paragraph 8 of Annex V of the JCPOA that, effective on JCPOA Implementation Day,29,30 Iran will provisionally apply the Additional Protocol to\nits Safeguards Agreement, pending its ratification by the Majlis (Parliament), and will fully implement the modified Code 3.1 of the Subsidiary Arrangements to its Safeguards Agreement.31.\"\nSince on implementation day sanctions will be removed, this may result in sanction removal prior to Iranian Parliament approval and therefore implementation of the transparency/ inspection component.
