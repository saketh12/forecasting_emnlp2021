First, Iran could actually carry out nuclear-related activity that leads to sanctions being imposed. Second, a foreign power could fabricate evidence that makes it appear that Iran has carried out nuclear-related activity. I think the odds of Iran carrying out nuclear-related activity during Rouhani's term are very small (1%), and I think the odds that Rouhani will be re-elected in May 2017 are very good (75%) based on his popular approval, working relationship with Khamenei, and Iran's growing GDP. I think the odds that a principalist will be elected are about 20%, and the odds that such a person would undertake nuclear-related activity in violation of the JCPOA before November 2017 are about 20%. So I calculate the odds for the first route to the outcome as roughly 5%. The second route is trickier. Trump does not seem to care for US intelligence analysis, which suggests that his team will want direct access to unprocessed intelligence. That intelligence could be loaded with false leads from states inimical to Iran, or from Iranian groups in exile that want to overthrow the current regime. I think amateur sleuths tend to weigh evidence on the basis of its emotional impact, so it may not be difficult to convince the Trump administration that Iran is undertaking a secret nuclear program (similar to the way Bush was led to believe Iraq had a WMD program). I put the odds at 80% that Trump will believe Iran is \"up to something nuclear\", and another 70% that Congress will go along with him. In order for sanctions to be effective, Trump would need to convince at least a few other members of the P5+1. China won't go along with it for economic reasons, and I don't think Germany will either as things stand now. Russia won't go along with it because of the post-Arab-Spring political bloc I think they are building in the Middle East, but they would be happy to see us shoot ourselves in the foot economically and strategically, so they won't stop us. That leaves France, where Le Pen might win, and the UK, where Iran is still not very popular. I think the odds of pulling together a coalition of right-leaning nations by November 2017 to impose sanctions are fair, maybe 30%. That makes the odds of the second route completing by November 2017 about 17%.

Without the UK the EU is likely to take the view that they have a deal with Iran and unless Iran blatantly breaks it they will want to keep trading, so the US should not expect EU support for sanctions.
