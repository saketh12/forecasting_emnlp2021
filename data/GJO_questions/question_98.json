Therefore, I think the consensus of 33 percent is low. NATO is holding its Warsaw Summit in July, which should provide further impetus for NATO and Montenegro to get this done within the year. Russia has little economic influence over Montenegro, thus diminishing intimidation from Moscow as a depressing factor. And although NATO membership is supported by less than half of Montenegro (although that is divided largely along ethnic lines), the PM just survived a no-confidence vote, so he probably has enough domestic political support to finalize NATO membership sometime in 2016 (particularly since he appears to have survived the vote by generally committing to reforms that NATO coincidentally supports -- at least rhetorically. Moreover, Montenegro represents relative low-hanging fruit (compared to Georgia, Macedonia, and others) for NATO to demonstrate that it remains a confident organization in the wake of its perceived acquiescence to Russian aggression in Ukraine.
