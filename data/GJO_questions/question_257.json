(this is up 47% compared to the same period last year. 640 for the same time period this coming half of the year would be 640+640=1280, which gives this answer a YES. \nTaliban seem to carry out the majority of the attacks, due to their much greater control of territory, and numbers. I will attribute a conservative 50% of total deaths to Taliban, and 10% of total deaths to IS. Thus IS would be responsible for 160 deaths for that portion of the year. It seems unlikely this will reach 1000 before the years end. \nIt\u2019s possible that the numbers of civilians killed by both sides will increase, but as the pro-government forces have already increased much more this year (47%), I doubt they will increase substantially more, in the coming 4 months. Possibly to a 50% increase on last year (Jul \u2013 Dec 2015). As such, I will say that 650 people between July and end of Dec will be killed by pro-government forces. That brings the total this year by pro-government forces to 1300, exceeding the mass killing definition. So my answer is Yes, It is likely to occur. But how likely? Over 50%, anyway. We have seen since July, that the US are not removing as many US soldiers from Afghanistan as previously planned, due to rising violence and tensions in Afghanistan. Also, IS and Taliban have formed a shaky peace pact to combat the US and pro-government afghan soldiers\u2026 it\u2019s possible that there will be even higher ground fighting \u2013 which is what is contributing most to civilian casualties at the moment.
