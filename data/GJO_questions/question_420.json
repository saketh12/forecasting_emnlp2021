The humanitarian system should therefore focus on uses in natural disasters and early recovery settings.\n\u2022 To tap into the growing interest in UAVs, particularly in technical communities, humanitarian organizations should engage in networks that promote good practices and guidance, and that can serve as a source of surge capacity.\n\u2022 Despite their potential to enhance humanitarian operations, more research and evidence is needed to identify the comparative advantages of using UAVs. More research is needed on in- tegrating aerial observation and data collection into needs and damage assessments, search and rescue, and other humanitarian functions.\nhttps://docs.unocha.org/sites/dms/Documents/Unmanned%20Aerial%20Vehicles%20in%20Humanitarian%20Response%20OCHA%20July%202014.pdf\n_________________________________\nCOMMENTS:  The usefulness of the UAV is undeniable; Interest is building in the use of UAVs to assist in search and rescue, particularly when equipped with infrared, or other specialty cameras. For example, the European Union is fund- ing ICARUS, a research project to develop unmanned search and rescue tools to assist human teams. To be useful, the UAVs and trained sta  must be available within 24-48 hours of a sudden-onset disaster. In addition these technical approaches must be integrated into the protocols for rescue teams, agreements for importing dis- aster response equipment, the International Search and Rescue Advisory Group (INSARAG) guidelines and other areas of policy.\nBUT there are challenges to an effective use of UAV. The biggest challenges to expanding the use of UAVs are legal and regulatory. In the OECD, most countries are just developing legal guidance for the commercial or civilian use of UAVs. Many countries in the global South, particularly those with large humanitarian caseloads, may have very little regulation at all. \nIn the U.S., commercial unmanned aerial system (UAS) licenses were granted on a case-by-case basis, subject to approval by the FAA.27 Similar restrictions exist in the UK and EU.28 Many countries where humanitarians are working do not yet have legal frameworks, meaning that use of UAVs will probably need to be cleared on an ad hoc basis with local and national authorities. To ensure long-term acceptance of these tools it will be critical that humanitarians comply with all host country regulations and develop appropriate agreements with regulators. A particular issue is interference with traditional air tra ic: in many countries it is illegal to fly anything within 5km of a commercial airport. As humanitar- ian operations o en center around emergency airports and logistics hubs, these restrictions are of particular concern.\nOther than the above there are also issues of:\nEthical procurement and partnerships\nPrivacy and data protection\nTransparency, informed consent and community engagement\n*** Ironing out all these issues takes time.
