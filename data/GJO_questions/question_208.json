Over production has led to graft. \nSome data has been skewed and over valued. Employee tells manager that production was A and manager tells director that production was B and director tells regional director that production was C and so forth. All are given kickback with the least amount going to the employee  and the government publishes the skewed data for investors. This is why Xi has arrested people on all levels.
