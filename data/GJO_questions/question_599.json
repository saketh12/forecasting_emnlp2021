The reported causes were for disputes over wages for loggers, sugar cane mill workers, and staff bonuses at a university, and, the far more serious reports of police shootings that led to deaths and riots. For those caused by the police not to occur, it would require a major concerted police training program with emphasis on both crowd control and the appropriate use of force. Even if immediately implemented and with strong departmental and political backing plus strong civil and NGO watch groups, this would require months to accomplish. The labor wage issue could easily go on for months as well based on the gap that exists between management and workers. For these reasons, both protests and riots could easily break out in October.
