My assumption is that it is holding fire for now to see what the US will do about it. It is thought possible that Trump will trade control of the Shoals in return for China dealing with the treats of North Korea, but from a medium/long term point of view it may not be wise to allow China to take any more de facto control of areas within the \"nine dotted line\". So at some point I believe the US will need to act, at which point there could be a clash. But with foreign affairs issues in Syria, with Russia, with Iran and with North Korea, my guess is that Trump and China might prefer to avoid raising tensions by starting work on the Shoal this year.
