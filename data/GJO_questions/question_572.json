Whitford: The court ruled unanimously that the plaintiffs \u2014 12 Wisconsin Democrats who alleged that Wisconsin's state legislative district plan had been subject to an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments \u2014 had failed to demonstrate standing to bring a complaint under Article III of the United States Constitution. Chief Justice John Roberts penned the majority opinion, in which Associate Justices Anthony Kennedy, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Samuel Alito, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan joined. Kagan filed a concurrence, which was joined by Ginsburg, Breyer, and Sotomayor. Associate Justice Clarence Thomas filed an opinion, joined by Associate Justice Neil Gorsuch, that concurred in part with the majority opinion and the court's judgment.\nRoberts noted that the court's opinion did not address the question of whether partisan gerrymandering claims are justiciable:\nIn cases where a plaintiff fails to demonstrate Article III standing, we usually direct the dismissal of the plaintiff's claims. This is not the usual case. It concerns an unsettled kind of claim this Court has not agreed upon, the contours and justiciability of which are unresolved. ...
