So assuming that in some markets hybrids are seen as part of the problem but in other markets hybrids are seen as being part of the solution it could be that the US would want hybrids and Europe would ban them. Petrol could be out but hydrogen could be in. \nIt is possible that a small brand belonging to a big company could go all electric e.g. the DS brand of the PSA Group.
