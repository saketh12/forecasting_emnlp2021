Plus a new government now needs to be formed. 2) President Macky Sall is expected to proceed with his third cabinet reshuffle with names in the next coming days which will again create tensions with his opponents. 3) Political opponents have still not been released including President Sall's likely presidential opponent, Dakar Mayor Khalifa Sall which caused protests in April this year and will likely to do the same as his trial date is set. It has been reported that authorities have responded quickly to protests so that may be a reason for there being few, if any, protests turning into riots.
