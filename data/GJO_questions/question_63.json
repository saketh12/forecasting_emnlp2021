I've still heard nothing as to the expected actions of the German prosecutors, but as to this question, I think that if there is a criminal indictment of VW coming, it would make the most political sense for Obama to postpone it until asfter the April trip. Alternatively, the laying of a criminal indictment prior to the trip might be a way for Obama to demonstrate some ability to exercise power over Germany. A problem with this latter strategy is that once such power has been exercised, any leverage it generated is gone. Short answer, Obama trip in April makes this less likely before then.
