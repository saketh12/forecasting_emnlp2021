Section 130 makes it a crime to publicly incite hatred against parts of the population or to call for violent or arbitrary measures against them or to insult, maliciously slur or defame them in a manner violating their (constitutionally protected) human dignity. Thus for instance it is illegal to publicly call certain ethnic groups \"maggots\" or \"freeloaders\". Volksverhetzung is punishable in Germany even if committed abroad and even if committed by non-German citizens, if only the incitement of hatred takes effect within German territory, e.g., the seditious sentiment was expressed in German writing or speech and made accessible in Germany (German criminal code's Principle of Ubiquity, Section 9 \u00a71 Alt. 3 and 4 of the Strafgesetzbuch)."], [5386, "2017-01-17T14:57:21Z", 0.99, "I think that this question will be decided in Europe, where legislation against hate speech and lies ('fake news' in newspeak) makes Facebook (and other platforms) responsible for allowing such content.
