Despite the recent perceived violations by Russia in its testing of the 9M729, it is still not a substantial attack for the treaty and there are still options left to bring Russia back into compliance. Among the most important of these options is the Special Verification Commission. Recently, Russia has criticized the United States  in its deployment of the Aegis Ashore launchers, by stating that the United States was in breach of the treaty as the launchers could carry prohibited missiles. The Commission could work by allowing inspectors to view both weapons and determine their capabilities, which would be a great sign of mutual respect. In addition, the US could pressure its allies into ensuring that the INF treaty remains a top priority on their agenda in their discussions with delegates of Russia.

As a result, 2,700 missiles and launchers have been destroyed by both countries.  Recent developments have made it more difficult for either country to remain committed to the treaty\u2019s premise.  Russia has violated the treaty by deploying a prohibited ground-launched cruise missile.  This action violates the treaty\u2019s prohibitions on producing, flight-testing, and possessing intermediate-range ground-launched missile.  On the other hand, Russia has claimed that the US has violated the treaty by possessing launchers for missile interceptors in Romania and Poland.

It did not serve to fully eliminate the ability of either the US or Russia to strike any given target on the planet with some form of nuclear weapon. Long range ICBMs, sea-based vehicles, and strategic bombers could still allow for this capability. As such the value in the INF was largely as a symbolic agreement continuing a (somewhat disingenuous) trend toward disarmament as well as a cost saving measure for both parties. If one is faced with evaluating the likelihood of either party suspending the agreement, the first step is to assess what would be gained. In my estimation, just as the value in entering it was largely symbolic, the main possibilities for leaving it would also be based in some type of symbolism. The United States has a president and congress who may increasingly find themselves in a position where appearing to be strong in opposition to Russia on anything will be politically useful. Additionally, Russia has grown increasingly brazen in its willingness to break international agreements and understandings without any realistic expectation of rebuke. As such a US suspension of the INF could serve as a means for the US administration/congress to  appear to be anti-Russia and publicly admonish Russian aggressive behavior in context that is not likely to be particularly impactful. \nBoth have implemented programs that are fundamental violations of the INF, if not in its wording in its spirit. Given that there has, to this point, been no repudiation for these violations, it is hard to see that there is any great strategic value in leaving the INF. For this reason as well as the fact that most observers (in the US particularly) don't rate the INF high on their list of important international agreements, making it weak as a symbolic token of defiance against Russia make it less likely to be used in this manner.
