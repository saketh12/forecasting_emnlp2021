If I split the difference between 29 and 100 percent, since I think a seven percent chance a month is too high, I get 64.5 (remarkably similar to someone else's guess).  If I split the difference between 0 percent and 7 percent, and go with (1.00-.035)^16, that works out to 54.6 percent.  However, what do we know about eradication of other diseases, or any other analagous cases?  If the per-month chance of it coming back is really only 2 percent, then the advance probability of continued eradication by then is \"really\" closer to 72 percent.  And if you figure a 2 percent chance this month, but only a one percent change 8 months from now, and only a .5 percent chance 8 months after that (probably closer to how a good actuarial model of these events might really look), then the probability of longer-term eradication only goes up from there.  Some research into past cases of disease eradication might clarify what the marginal probability each month really might be, and better frame the overall chances.

The time frame is 16 months to go.  100 percent /14 months = 7 percent chance a month (high) down to a zero percent chance (low) if you'd like to believe it's eradicated, no way it could spread from elsewhere, etc.  7 percent a month leaves a 93 percent chance it hasn't happened by next month to the power of 16 months leaves a 29 percent chance of Africa being polio-free after 16 months.
