In 2017 Trump announced new plans for the \"war\" in Afghanistan - which he will not stay consistent on as he does not stay focus on one thing, rather tends to focus on domestic politics. In 2014, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry set up an agreement that placed Ghani in power; thus the US really cannot remove him from the given power. Ghani's removal will have to come from a national movement, citizens protesting Taliban and ISIS controlled areas to the government.

The low probability of this event occurring is based upon several factors.  The event has only about 4 months and 1 week to occur.  Ashraf Ghani has been president of Afghanistan since 2014 and does not seem to be interested in stepping down voluntarily or due to a democratic election.  Afghanistan\u2019s Independent Election Commission announced that the country will hold its parliamentary and district council elections on 7 July 2018, which is 6 days after the 1 July 2018 deadline in the question.  Also, this proposed election is scheduled to take place 3 years past the expiration of the sitting parliament\u2019s 5-year mandate.  A reshaping of the parliament and district councils could factor into Ghani\u2019s decision to step down, but in the unlikely event that it even takes place, it will occur after the deadline in the question.  Historically, elections in Afghanistan face major hurdles and difficulties due to declining security and safety in many parts of the country.  The political instability and the public\u2019s insecurity will likely derail the parliamentary election, which undoubtedly will result in Ghani\u2019s power grip on the Afghani presidency.
