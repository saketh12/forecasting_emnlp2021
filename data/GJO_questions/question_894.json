If they end up with some sort of regulation, it's possible it could get done in this time frame.  I'll give it 5% until I see the proposed regulation. Like the other question, this one doesn't take into account a court challenge to any regulation. So any ban would count unless it's challenged in court immediately?\n------------\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-guns-justice/sessions-says-justice-dept-inching-closer-to-banning-bump-stocks-idUSKCN1GB24W"], [50954, "2018-03-07T19:43:18Z", 0.25, "Doesn't have enough public support yet."], [12879, "2018-03-07T19:18:59Z", 0.75, "In all likelihood YES it will be banned prior to 1 January 2019......"], [39918, "2018-03-07T19:08:38Z", 0.87, "Law is to easy"], [49545, "2018-03-07T19:04:12Z", 0.19, "Interesting that this question was posed again, but with a date 6 months after the original question end (1 JUL 18).  Makes it a lot easier to kill two birds with one stone though.  The longer we get away from the use of a bump stock in a mass shooting, the likelihood that it will be banned will be decreased.  So, going off of a lot of analysis and comments on twin question with the earlier date, I believe it is highly unlikely before 1 JUL, but more likely, if regulation is used, that it will happen between 1 Jul and 1 Jan.  If anything legislative happens it will be during this session, so I don't really see any higher chance of it happening after 1 Jul than before.

This issue is also a relatively easy \"give\"  for the gun industry and the NRA. But agree with those who say we won't see real change in this area until Congresspeople begin to lose seats because of pro-gun stances.
