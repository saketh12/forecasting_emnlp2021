The book has raised my interest in the long history of US misunderstandings about Chinese political dynamics and intentions.  Time and again US players have seen what they want to see in China, and missed the reality.  With the distracting blizzard of Trump tweet commentary, perhaps today's big mistake is to see the North Korea problem as a North Korea problem, when it appears to be a China problem.  China's expansionist strategy has many elements, including claims to the South China Sea, naval base construction in the Indian Ocean, recent border clashes with India and relentless pressure on US affiliates including the Philippines, South Korea and Japan.   If China's strategic goal is to break apart the structure that has controlled the Western Pacific region since the end of WW II, North Korea is simply China's useful dog in this campaign.  China's ideal preferred end game would include:  (1) tractable vassal states in Japan, Philippines, Vietnam that have no alliance with the United States.  (2) restoration of Taiwan and various perimeter island chains as China possessions,  (3) reunification of the Korean peninsula under a socialist or communist political regime that China would dominate, and (4) Chinese control of the Eastern hemisphere to a degree that would be similar to what the Monroe Doctrine once was in the Western Hemisphere.  If this is the great game being played, six party talks would be a farce, and no progress will come from getting in a room one-on-one with Kim.
