Although the Guardian Council is unlikely to approve all candidacies,...\n...surge in the number of registered candidates can be traced to five main motivating factors....Moreover, since the norm of having political parties does not exist in Iran, some only put forth candidacies because they like the idea of going to the Ministry of Interior to register and getting the related media attention. In addition, considering the rate of unemployment and economic decline in Iran, certain educated but jobless individuals believe that becoming a member of parliament is an opportunity to gain access to better economic and political opportunities....Second is the Reformists\u2019 strategy. Supporters of the Rouhani administration, including Reformists, have adopted the strategy of introducing a lot of candidates in the hopes that if their leading figures are disqualified, lesser-known Reformists will be given the chance to run for parliament and pursue the Reformist agenda. This strategy is useful for mobilizing people in order to change the political makeup of parliament and the Assembly of Experts, both of which are currently dominated by non-Reformists. Prominent Reformists can of course wield more influence and be more effective compared to second- or third-rate colleagues. However, the Reformists are not going to give up easily. They are hoping to at least increase the political cost for the conservatives if the Guardian Council engages in mass disqualifications of registered candidates....Third is the most important political turning point of Iran in the next 10 years. There is speculation that in the next decade, considering the age of Iran\u2019s 76-year-old, ailing Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the country will have a new leader. Considering the authority enjoyed by the supreme leader within Iran\u2019s political system, various groups are looking to secure their positions in the Assembly of Experts, which is tasked with selecting the next supreme leader. Rafsanjani\u2019s proposal to establish a \u201cleadership council\u201d instead of a single supreme leader has been criticized by the conservatives but welcomed by the Reformists and alternative political thinkers. On the other hand, if Reformists and supporters of the Rouhani administration manage to win a majority of seats in parliament, sidelined Reformists can return to politics, and thus the atmosphere of moderation and reform long promised by Rouhani can finally be institutionalized....Fourth is women\u2019s rights campaigns....Last but certainly not least is that the outcome of the latest presidential elections continues to impact Iranian politics. The 2013 presidential vote proved that by participating in elections and supporting a certain candidate, people can overcome some of their economic and political problems. Indeed, Iranians realized that by taking part in polls and electing Rouhani, they could help solve the nuclear crisis, which had been ongoing since 2003.

The United Arab Emirates also downgraded relations.\nAt first glance, it may appear that Islamic vigilantes had created a diplomatic crisis that fuelled tensions between the two regional superpowers.\nBut reform-minded analysts warned that Iran\u2019s hardliners have exploited public outrage to undermine President Hassan Rouhani and his allies.\n\u201cWithout doubt, the incident is related to the current tense political infighting,\u201d said one analyst. \u201cMore bad news will come soon. There will be a further build-up of pressure on the reformists.\u201d\nIran struck a landmark nuclear agreement with big powers last summer, which is expected to be implemented this month. The benefits of that accord \u2014 following the lifting of economic sanctions \u2014 should increase Mr Rouhani\u2019s leverage in Iran\u2019s sophisticated corridors of power.\nHardliners, who were shocked to lose to Mr Rouhani in the 2013 presidential election, hope to win back support in crucial polls next month after a series of setbacks, that included the nuclear deal.\n\u201cIt is hard to believe that some people threw Molotov cocktails at the Saudi embassy and confiscated it for one or two hours without being supported by some [power] centres,\u201d said Mohammad-Sadegh Javadi-Hesar, a reformist politician. \u201cThat\u2019s why they easily take selfies and seem confident they will be rewarded for their radical stances.\u201d\nIran\u2019s hardliners are mostly based in the elite Revolutionary Guard, the judiciary, parliament, state-run television and the Guardian Council, a constitutional watchdog that vets candidates\u2019 Islamic (and political) credentials. The council is expected to bar many reformist candidates from running for the polls by questioning their allegiance to the Islamic ideology.\nAfter nearly a decade of isolation Iran has a deal with six world powers to wind back progress towards building a nuclear bomb in exchange for a reversal of international economic sanctions\nEven the grandson of the founder of the Islamic revolution, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, may not pass the tough vetting procedure. Hassan Khomeini \u2014 who is allied with reformists and whose candidacy has outraged hardliners \u2014 is obliged to take a test on Tuesday to certify he is a suitably senior cleric to enter into the Experts Assembly, which could decide on who should be Iran\u2019s next supreme leader.\nEven so, reformist analysts say that while senior political leaders may approve a crackdown on reformists, they doubt they would have given the green light to storm an embassy. The international repercussions for such a drastic move would be too severe for the country.\nEven a hardline cleric such as Ahmad Khatami, who leads Tehran\u2019s Friday prayers, condemned the attack on the embassy.\nMr Khatami said that \u201cwe don\u2019t achieve anything by attacking embassies and setting fire to them\u201d and that \u201cit was not appropriate to attack the Saudi embassy and consulate \u201d.\nIf the attack leads to the barring of Iranians travelling to the Hajj pilgrimage in Mecca, it would prove particularly embarrassing for the country\u2019s senior leaders.\nIran\u2019s supreme leader and ultimate decision maker, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, had warned after a similar attack on the British embassy in Tehran in 2011 that diplomatic missions should enjoy complete security.\nHardliners might be staunch supporters of Iran\u2019s supreme leader, but analysts say that they cannot resist the opportunity to weaken their rivals.\nAyatollah Khamenei cannot afford to allow severe prosecution of those embassy demonstrators as they have come to the Islamic Republic\u2019s aid before and carried out brutal crackdowns on opposition movements.\n\u201cHardliners need to radicalise the political and social atmosphere so they can eliminate their rivals under the pretext of national security,\u201d Mr Javadi-Hesar added.\n\u201cTheir number in various centres may be equal to a few brigades who can be quickly organised to confront people with moderate groups who are now identified with Mr Rouhani.\u201d"], [14327, "2016-01-05T04:55:02Z", 0.9, "http://www.globalpost.com/article/6714404/2016/01/04/khamenei-says-us-faces-punch-mouth-iran-polls"], [1450, "2016-01-05T02:32:16Z", 0.85, "Recent issues with KSA will make it more likely for the conservatives to tighten their grip."], [14327, "2016-01-04T18:59:47Z", 0.85, "Moving up the probability.
