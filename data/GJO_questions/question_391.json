I doubt that Germans would want an Italian style system where weak governments get replaced every few months (as they used to). The real problem is having the AfD getting votes, but the CDU ruling out a coalition with them.

Two such instruments are available:\n-\thttps://www.inwt-statistics.de/blog-artikel-lesen/wahlprognose-fuer-die-bundestagswahl-2017.html#Prognose (German)\n-\thttp://www.thecrosstab.com/germany-2017/ (English)\n-\tRaw data is provided here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_German_federal_election,_2017\nThe German page by INWT Statistics is also modeling the probability that Merkel can stay German Chancellor: to date this is 84,5 per cent. However there are some arguments this could be too high and some that this could be too low.\n84,5 per cent is too low:\n-\tThe poll aggregators model a red-red-green coalition (SPD-LEFT-Greens) as more likely than a Grand Coalition of CDU und SPD, if both were possible. This is a strong assumption since \u2013 first \u2013 voters do not prefer the red-red-green coalition and both, SPD and the LEFT, have a very considerable disagreement among leaders and rank-and-file to go ahead with such a coalition. If possible, I would say that the chances are \u2013 at best \u2013 50 percent for this coalition to be formed. Schultz clearly signals to voters that he does not want form a coalition with the LEFT in the first place.\n-\tGiven the fact that the SPD has to make a statement on coalition options and given the clear impression from several regional elections that red-red-green coalition is not preferred by the voters, it seems likely that this route to the Chancellorship is completely down for Martin Schulz, the candidate for Chancellorship of the SPD. The only route that he then has is a coalition with the Liberals and the Greens. But: If this kind of a \u2018traffic light coalition\u2019 would be possible and given that the CDU would have the biggest seat share (very, very likely: 99 percent) a CDU-Liberal-Green coalition would be possible, either. The Liberals and the Greens would be in the position to decide which side they would join and which of the candidates would become German Chancellor. Greens tend to the SPD camp, Liberals tend to the CDU camp. That would very likely end up in a stalemate. Consequence: Grand Coalition, Chancellor: Merkel.\n-\tGiven the enormous success of the Liberals in the regional elections in North Rhine Westphalia (12+ percent), it could become more likely than pollsters currently measure that a CDU-Liberal government could be formed (if so, with a very tiny majority). So it seems that Merkel will have another realistic option to stay Chancellor \u2013 beside the Grand Coalition.\n-\tMerkel is probably least prone to political scandals among the Western leaders and candidates. A Fillon-like scandal in Germany seems very unlikely, but Merkel not even had to witness a scandal like some of her Cabinet members that \u2013 nevertheless \u2013 would not lead to their resignation. And this holds true if one looks back all the years she is in German politics. That makes her approval ratings and her electoral performance a reliable factor to count on.\n-\tSchulz and the SPD lack the magic triangle: a harmonizing combination of (1) Candidate, (2) an issue that voters have an interest in and (3) a favorable media agenda.\nHowever, 84,5 per cent could be too high:\n-\tThere is so much time until elections take place\u2026 Many things can happen. Merkel almost lost safe elections in 2005 against the \u2013 incumbent \u2013 Gerhard Schr\u00f6der. Scandals among rank-and-file are always possible, particularly in the CDU \u2013 even if they seem to be harmless in international perspective.\n-\tIt is very likely that the current offspring of the CDU and Liberal polls will normalize a bit an SPD will gain momentum. Too, it is likely that Schulz will find an issue and \u2013 may be, may be \u2013 media agenda will support him (most journalist in Germany lean toward the left side of the political spectrum).\n-\tIt would be very awkward for Merkel and the CDU if there would be a terrorist attack with an Islamic background or something similar: a series of violent crimes with nationwide media coverage committed by refugees or other foreigners (because people blame Merkel personally for the refugee inflow in 2015; and national security and law-and-order is a unique selling point of the CDU). If refugee crisis would rebound it would be disastrous for the CDU. However, it is kind of the absurd situation in Germany in the Merkel era that such events would not be to the advantage of the SPD; rather, the Alternative for Germany (AfD) would profit from such events. \u2013 Even under these very unfavorable circumstances for the CDU: the Chancellor is very likely to stay Merkel!\nAll in all, it seems to date, that Merkel is fairly well \u2018priced\u2019 with 88 to 90 percent probability to stay Chancellor of Germany after the next parliamentary elections."], [27461, "2017-05-20T00:36:58Z", 0.95, "Shultz said this week that he won't form a coalition with the hard left (Die Linke).
