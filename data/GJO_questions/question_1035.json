The CME Fedwatch website predicts Fed rate movements based on the futures market. Right, now it places a 74% probability that the Fed will raise rates at its December 18-19 meeting by 25 bps (https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html). \nSince this probability is well known and considered by bond investors, I\u2019ll say that the remaining 24% uncertainty is not already baked into the current 2 year rate and that there should only be a 6.5 basis point (25 bps increase x 26% of uncertainty) increase in the 2 year rate. If that happens, the 2 year adjusts accordingly, and the 10 year rate remains unchanged, the spread reduced to 6.5 bps. At this point, I\u2019ll assume a base rate of 0% probability of inversion. \nTheoretically, the yield curve should never invert because longer term investors demand a term premium. So, as the 2 year rate increases, the 10 year should increase by and unknown amount. Though, the term premium, as determined by the current spread is very small. In addition, an inversion is a very rare occurrence (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/T10Y2Y). My probability remains 0% at this point. \nCurrent economic reports also lead bond investors to draw conclusions about rates in the future which can have a positive or negative effect on longer term yields. I don\u2019t claim to have any more incite about upcoming economic reports than anyone else, but we have to consider the short window before the question concludes. For instance, after the Fed announces its decision to raise rates (or to leave it unchanged or decrease), there are only 6 days (excluding holidays) until the question concludes. Thus, reducing the probability of inversion. So, I\u2019ll remain at 0% probability \nAnother thing to consider is that foreign countries are also investors in US debt markets. A few major economies have extremely low or negative rates and have found US debt to be more attractive from both yield and creditworthiness perspectives. Additional buying of US debt from these countries would put downward pressure on US yields. Since this situation has persisted for quite some time and would likely affect both the 2 and 10 year rates, I believe that if this assessment is correct the affects will have no further downward pressure on rates unless those rates were to decrease. I think this is very unlikely considering their central bank agendas. In addition, any rate increases in those countries would have upward pressure on rates, but that is very unlikely between now and the end of the question. I\u2019m not changing my probability because of this unless something significant happens. \nOn the other hand, because we are starting from such a historically small spread, any negative news or a continued bearish sentiment in equity markets could cause the 10 year rate to decrease and reduce the spread at any time between now and the end of the question."], [33789, "2018-12-21T17:33:29Z", 0.0, "Five days is simply not enough time for the yield curve, which rarely if every inverts, to do so unless a recession is going to blindside everyone.

The CME Fedwatch website predicts Fed rate movements based on the futures market. Right, now it places a 76% probability that the Fed will raise rates at its December 18-19 meeting by 25 bps (https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html). \nSince this probability is well known and considered by bond investors, I\u2019ll say that the remaining 24% uncertainty is not already baked into the current 2 year rate and that there should only be a 6 basis point (25 bps increase x 24% of uncertainty) increase in the 2 year rate. If that happens, the 2 year adjusts accordingly, and the 10 year rate remains unchanged, the spread reduced to 20 bps. At this point, I\u2019ll assume a base rate of 0% probability of inversion.\nTheoretically, the yield curve should never invert because longer term investors demand a time premium. So, as the 2 year rate increases, the 10 year should increase by and unknown amount. Though, the time premium, as determined by the current spread is very small. In addition, an inversion is a very rare occurrence (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/T10Y2Y). My probability remains 0% at this point.\nCurrent economic reports also lead bond investors to draw conclusions about rates in the future which can have a positive or negative effect on longer term yields. I don\u2019t claim to have any more incite about upcoming economic reports than anyone else, but we have to consider the short window before the question concludes. For instance, after the Fed announces its decision to raise rates (or to leave it unchanged or decrease), there are only 6 days (excluding holidays) until the question concludes. Thus, reducing the probability of inversion. So, I\u2019ll remain at 0% probability\nAnother thing to consider is that foreign countries are also investors in US debt markets. A few major economies have extremely low or negative rates and have found US debt to be more attractive from both yield and creditworthiness perspectives. Additional buying of US debt from these countries would put downward pressure on US yields. Since this situation has persisted for quite some time and would likely affect both the 2 and 10 year rates, I believe that if this assessment is correct the affects will have no further downward pressure on rates unless those rates were to decrease. I think this is very unlikely considering their central bank agendas. In addition, any rate increases in those countries would have upward pressure on rates, but that is very unlikely between now and the end of the question. I\u2019m not changing my probability because of this unless something significant happens. \nOn the other hand, because we are starting from such a historically small spread, any negative news or a continued bearish sentiment in equity markets could cause the 10 year rate to decrease and reduce the spread at any time between now and the end of the question. \nFor the final answer to remain at 0% seems foolish. I\u2019ll add a somewhat arbitrary 10% points to my probability to account for the possibility of negative economic news or random exogenous event. For instance, heightened trade war threats or other negative geopolitical event.
