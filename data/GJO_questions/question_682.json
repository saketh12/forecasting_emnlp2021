The only real possibility of Kim Jong-un stepping down would be in an overthrow of his rule, which could become a possibility either from an uprising within the Communist Party or a popular revolt. In order for a popular revolt to have any chance of occurring, the economic conditions in North Korea must become very dire and they certainly are on their way, especially with the new rounds of sanctions by the West and China's willingness to begin enforcement of their sanctions as well. However, it can be assumed that a dictator such as Kim Jong-un would have an interest in prolonging his rule for as long as possible. Therefore, he must raise the living standards of the North Korean people, which can only be achieved through negotiation on the possible removal of sanctions. So far, Kim Jong-un has been willing to compromise and hold talks. He sent a delegation to South Korea for the Olympics and will be meeting with the South Korean President at the end of April. There are also negotiations underway for Kim Jong-un to meet with President Trump after his meeting with the South Korean leader. Although the sudden shift in policy may be surprising, North Korean defector Ri Jong Ho sees this as perfectly understandable. Ri explains that North Korea's economy is in a dire situation and Kim Jong-un has an interest in preserving his rule. Kim Jong-un remains distrustful of China and believes that the US will be instrumental in his ability to retain power. Ri's revelations show that Kim Jong-un is aware of the problems facing his country and he is willing to negotiate. However, talks and negotiation may not be enough to lift sanctions. South Korean Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon has stated that talks must be followed by substantive action and despite Kim Jong-un's willingness to negotiate, he must also be willing to make compromises. Whether Kim Jong-un agrees to such compromises remains to be seen, however, there is a possibility with talks underway for substantive action to occur, and if they do, would certainly extend his rule for the foreseeable future.

Starving people don't rise up unless conditions are right. Read your Stalin. \n3. Sanctions and closed borders create opportunities on the black market. I've seen this pretty up close in other places. The idea that sanctions are really what they are on paper is laughable. That kind of thinking is a product of people in the Western world who never lived in a poor area.  Neither Russia nor China has that good of control over their border if they want to. It's like ours with cocaine. \n4. The USA supports the coup in Ukraine (with stationing of the US vice president's son in the country to collect Burisma oil stock and get rich). The USA calls the people of Ukraine who did not overthrow their government, \"the rebels\" which is full Orwellian doublespeak. The USA then sanctioned Russia for taking Crimea back after the province voted to do that overwhelmingly. Ukraine is the soft underbelly of Russia and Russia was promised it would be off limits. This put Russia on a war footing, because Russia has been invaded multiple times from Europe. This showed Russia and China that US words mean nothing and they cannot trust us. So, they adjusted. NK was a pain in the ass to Russia for most of its post-soviet period. But now, NK serves a purpose. Saber-rattling mad dog to distract the white house and cause trouble. A dangerous dog because NK has been able to hit some major cities in Russia for a while. \n5. China has also paid attention to Ukraine. China and Russia both see the Ukraine revolution as a sign of US aggression intending to overthrow them. China wants to expand its sphere into the  South China Sea. So, China also rediscovered the utility of NK. For a long time China's interest was declining. NK has had nuclear missiles aimed at Beijing for a long time. Starting with Obama's South China sea confrontation, what happened? NK postured and the US press went nuts and the White House got overwhelmed. Tillerson and Trump beat the drums against China trade, and boom. NK forces Tillerson to come on bended knee for help. All very jolly for China. \n6. The more sanctions we put on NK, the more we put Kim Jong-Un in the hands of Russia and China, mostly China. He has to dance for his dinner. \n7. China and Russia both want NK right where it is. NK has a job, and that job is to be a bulwark against US troops on the continent. China will not allow US troops to be within driving distance of Beijing any more than we would let Chinese troops do that to Washington, DC. \n8. Even in the unlikely event that the Trump administration actually convinces Kim that he has no better option than to launch his missiles at the USA and all the US installations in the Pac Rim, Kim will survive. I rather think China prefers to have the USA as a trading partner, but Kim won't die in any war.
