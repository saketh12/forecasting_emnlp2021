I wrote last time that there was risk of circularity in ignoring the polls and looking at the betting odds, as the bookmakers were also ignoring the polls and all of us were looking at Scottish referendum as the playbook for how the vote would turn out.  The tragic death of Jo Cox has certainly placed Remain in the winning position, witnessed by the swing in the polls back to Remain after the weekend.  I also noted before that in a fairly large, self-confident country like the UK, political campaigns needed to balance hope and fear issues.  A fear-only campaign can work in Scotland but not in the UK as a whole.  The Leave camp had nostalgia of \"sovereignty\" and old empire and the fear of unlimited \"immigration\", while Remain was unbalanced with only the fear issue of \"economy recession\", however with this terrible event last week, I believe the Remain camp has been able to catalyse its positive message.  This has been confirmed by David Cameron recent positive stance as well as his tweet of Jo Cox's final op-ed about the benefits of EU immigration for the UK.  Considering this was an issue Remain would not try rebut but reassure in public, I sense they are more confident of the mood of the majority in the wake of her death.   There has been a blistering  critique in the pro Leave press about any the use of Ms Cox's name or death during the rest of the campaign, but politics is a messy business about messaging.   The Vote Remain camp would argue to ignore and blank out her death would be equally demeaning for what she had been campaigning for and what she stood for \"pro-immigration\" and \"pro-EU\".   In politics, seminal events matter.  The UK is a secular, liberal society in the large political \"middle\" and I assume that is where the undecideds live.  The undecideds should swing to Remain more decisively as the implicit, anti-minority principles of the right wing elements within the Leave Vote are highlighted more vigorously in the press.  There is also a crescendo of business leaders and groupings of scholars/\"experts\" like Noble Laureate economists' open letter coming out in the past few days for UK to stay in EU.   In addition and probably more important, publications like the Times and Economist which are typically critical of the EU have come out for Remain.  (I think Rupert Murdoch is hedging his bets).  What is interesting about this activity of the Remain supporters is that its all coming out nearer to the actual poll date whether by design or in reaction to the previous weak polls.  One forecaster wrote presciently when up weighting his forecast precisely when polls had swung to Leave, stating and I paraphrase, the weak polls for Remain will reinvigorate campaign and create a sense of urgency for voter turnout supporting Remain which was one of the significant risks, an apathetic voting block."], [25345, "2016-06-20T09:26:27Z", 0.55, "Comment deleted on Jun 20, 2016 09:33AM UTC"], [26183, "2016-06-20T09:14:06Z", 0.85, "Bump towards remain based on polls over the last few days, and prominent Brexit campaigners abandoning ship.

I will skip the detail but what matters is press with impact on swing voters. The Times coming out in favour of In as it is rumoured will have more impact than those who cater for the die-hearts.

Labour comes across as unconvincing In, Lib Dems are absent from everything and the Conservatives are facing long-brewing fundamental internal divisions across all demographic dimensions. (3) Polls in the last Elections proved v unreliable for reasons still unclear. In my view, Out supporters have been a lot more vocal recently, shifting the argument almost exclusively to Sovereignty and Immigration. In comparison, In supporters are typically more moderate and less vocal. (4) In has conducted a poor campaign, particularly recently but appears to have won the economic argument clearly, hence Out has shifted to the Sovereignty/Immigration issues.

William Hague (a consummate Eurosceptic) has spoken out in favour of remain with the argument that Cameron has dealt with future sovereignty issues with the EU already due to the pressure the UK gov was able to put on the EU over the threat of leaving.

Looking at the forecasters here and the bookmakers, I suspect there could be risks of group think and circularity in the decision process.  Three important factors are raised consistently as a basis for this groups' forecasts to get to the average 70% probability, 1) the polls are not reliable, 2) the betting market is more reliable, and 3) the Scottish referendum.  Firstly I would make the assumption that polling methodologies have been improved since the Scottish and National election failures.  Secondly, the betting market is probably using the same factors we are using, polls are unreliable and Scottish referendum turned to No vote at the polling station, while late polls were signalling a surging Yes.  There is a lot of recency bias here.   But these are two different referendums with different hopes and fears.  I think it may be worthwhile weighing up the hopes over fears for Brexit.  Sovereignty and Immigration are the main hope and fear factors for the Leave campaign and economic deep recession is the fear factor for Remain.  The Remain campaign's biggest drawback is that neither Cameron nor Corbyn are true EU believers, so the campaign lacks that balance.  Unlike the Scottish referendum where Cameron government and the EU played hardball and stoked sufficient fear with Scottish and their small economy, the UK is a large economy and surely more confident in face of the risks and fears of the Remain campaign.  The UK also has a political and cultural history of \"Splendid Isolation\" from continental Europe and its affairs.  It helps being an island.

My answer in three words: \"status quo bias.\" We saw in the Scottish Independence referendum that undecided voters broke for 'Remain' at a disproportionate rate.

I am basing this forecast on the fact that both online polls, phone polls, and betting markets are all above 50% for remain, ex undecided, and that since the February 22nd announcement there has been relatively little variability around these numbers, with remain gaining ground. I will be monitoring polling closely, however, as this will be the biggest indicator to how the public is internalizing the arguments of the various platforms.\nPhones: 51% to 39%\nBidding Markets 60% v 40%\nOnline Polls: 52% to 48% \nPoll of Polls: 51% to 49%\nLeaving an economic union like the EU is a pretty rare occurrence, and very rare for a large stable country like the EU. The only examples of countries actually leaving the EU (actually its predecessor the EEA) are Algeria, which declared independence from France, Greenland, which remains a dependency of Denmark which is a member of the EU, and Saint Barthelemy an overseas department of the French government. None of these are even remotely comparable to the UK. OPEC has had some defections although OPEC is not an economic community in the way the UK is, most defectors have returned, and generally the defectors are weak nations that feel they are not getting much benefit from OPEC despite paying large fees. Other examples of states/Economic union break ups seem to be rooted in ethnic struggle, which is not something we are seeing with the UK. Thus, there is limited historical precedent for an event like this. \nThe EU has a long history of euro-skepticism in government that ultimately gets shot down. In 1974 the ascendant Labour government had campaigned on a promise to hold a referendum on EEC accession. The ensuing debate looked remarkably similar to today\u2019s debate. The Labour cabinet was split on supporting remain vs leave. Ultimately a new agreement with the EEC was reached and, in the first nationwide referendum ever, the British people overwhelmingly voted to remain a part of the EEC. Certainly Britain\u2019s economic position relative to the rest of Europe was a bit different in 1974 than today but it is interesting that the tone and nature of the arguments seems to be so similar. \nThere are three things that have me concerned as I watch this:\n1)\tPolling credibility. After both the Scottish referendum and the 2015 Parliamentary elections polling in the UK was more or less shredded from a credibility perspective. For one, they were flat wrong, and two there were significant differences between online and phone polling. It will be essential to monitor the volatility of these series and their direction going forward. \n2)\tThe arguments being posed by both sides are not salient to real voters. The Remain campaign\u2019s website has a few snippets with limited additional factual evidence. There is a seemingly credible element about the true \u201ccost\u201d from a dollars and cents (I know they don\u2019t use dollars) perspective to leaving the trade union and how it would hit the pocket books of consumers, otherwise it is pretty weak. The leave campaign, while disorganized, has arguments that a much more salient for individual voters. I am also having trouble reconciling some of this trade stuff. Goods trade appears to be covered by the WTO and remain campaigners suggest that services will not be covered, but as signatories to the GATT the UK and EU are signatories to GATS as well. So how will single market access for services be affected? \n3)\tMy small sample of Londoners amongst whom I have conducted my own non-scientific polling are all pretty pessimistic. The most common line of reasoning I hear is \u201cIf you were the UK today would you vote to join?\u201d that\u2019s a red herring but people don\u2019t seem to care. \nThe Remain campaign is going to have to convince the undecided voters to vote to remain in order to secure victory. I think that there will be some moderate success there but current polling seems to be pretty clearly signaling remain. I think that the volatility of the current polling, although they may be somewhat unreliable, is what will drive my forecast going forward. \nSome Links (many of which I pulled from previous forecasters)\nhttp://www.strongerin.co.uk/#QBqTe6zczyKQEf4J.97\nhttp://www.voteleavetakecontrol.org/briefing_newdeal\nhttp://whatukthinks.org/eu/opinion-polls/poll-of-polls/\nhttps://yougov.co.uk/news/2016/03/05/yougov-view-remain-ahead-support-fundamentals/\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_European_Communities_membership_referendum,_1975\n"], [9549, "2016-03-14T14:28:52Z", 0.25, "The pension overhang in the eu is so large that the uk will decide to avoid a dying horse.

The media is largely anti-EU. Half the Tory party is anti-EU. Both leaders of the Tories and Labour have at best luke-warm support for the EU. London a key pro-EU voting area, has just seen Boris Johnson come out against the EU (where he is very popular despite the city being fairly liberal).  The pro-EU groups - liberals, and Blairite labour, have essentially been completely eliminated from contemporary British politics, so will have limited influence. The Scots are pro-EU, but this could backfire, if southern English conservatives see the EU as a something the Scottish like, so therefore they should dislike it on principle. A similar problem lies for the business lobby, in that big business is pro-EU, however, again if it pushes too hard it would be seen as 'interfering' in the people's will - big business is not popular in the UK. Small businesses are less involved in foreign trade, so will vote more in line with general cultural views on the referendum, rather than being a pro-lobby so to speak.
