I have not heard new sanctions on Iran coming from the Republican Presidential candidates so it seems to be out of the conservative cross hairs for the moment in the US. Should Iran be seen as uncooperative against IS will need to push this up. With the US presidential elections underway, small stories can get blown out of proportion by candidates and the media. So there's always that possibility: Iran detaining US journalists, \"discovery\" of a economic or military deals with North Korea, etc. it's the Rumsfeld unknown unknowns that are likely to take us by surprise.
