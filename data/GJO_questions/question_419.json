The most likely fatal incident would be that some military people are playing some game of chicken to see who turns away first, and someone pushes it too far. If fighter planes collided there could be one or two fatalities, it ships or boats collided there could be more fatalities. If a passenger plane was shot down hundreds of fatalities would be possible. \nI would anticipate that this question could be the subject of arguments. There are many fatal incidents involving the military every month, they fall into three groups; equipment failures/malfunctions; personnel errors (e.g. pilot errors) and deliberate hostile or stupid acts. If for example a plane buzzed a small patrol boat and the boat in trying to avoid the plane hit another boat and people died, would that count for the purposes of this question even though the plane had not actually hit anyone. \nMy forecast is that in an area where a country's military are trying to demonstrate control where previously they did not there is a a likelihood that civilian lives will be lost every year. In this case it is a very large area, but mostly sea so the most likely casualties would be fishermen. They would not count for the purposes of the question unless they were supported by the military of one country and killed due the actions of another country (one country being China). If China continues to push its claim I would think a 3 person incident is likely every 5 years or so, which equates to a 15% chance of it happening before 1 Jan 2018.
