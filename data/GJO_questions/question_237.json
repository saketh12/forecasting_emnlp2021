David Cameron's exit from the PM seat can only aggravate the situation. Cameron's personal reassurances appeared to play a significant role in keeping proud Scots in the fold. Without power to enforce change, it is hard to believe that Cameron's reassurances, if offered, would be met with much credulity. In the end, I strongly believe that the Scots will seize the opportunity to launch another attempt at withdrawal. In my mind, question isn't if, but when the Scots will brave another go.
