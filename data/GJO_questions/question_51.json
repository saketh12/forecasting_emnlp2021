The question as posed is, \"Will any disputes... be referred to the Joint Commission before 1 July 2016?\" This is an entirely different matter. I think the west will take great pains to keep such a referral from happening, because 1) it can be interpreted as a failure of the west to negotiate the treaty properly (a controversy especially to be avoided in the U.S. during a presidential election) and 2) what if the Joint Commission rules against Iran on an issue, and Iran rejects the ruling, and does what it wants anyway? The sanctions against Iran are supposed to be completely eradicated by the end of 2015. Once the sanctions are rolled back, I think they will be extremely difficult to reimpose and I don't think \"snapback\" will work in any meaningful fashion. So my thinking is that by the middle of next year, Iran will pretty much be able to dig in its heels on any issue it chooses, and the west will have to mollify Iran.
