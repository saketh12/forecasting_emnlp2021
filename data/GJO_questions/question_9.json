CDS's are trading at levels that suggest a default (79% in the next 12 months and 20% in the next 5 years). Oils prices that are responsible for 95% of Venezuela's GDP are in the lowest level in more than a decade (US$ 21,5 per barrel). Government debt is 50% of Venezuela's GDP and external debt mounts to US$ 185 billion. Venezuela is import dependent of many goods including food and it imports a total of US$ 12.25 billion a year. On top of that, Venezuela in the last 16 months had paid more than US$ 27 billion and in order to meet its obligation this year it will need to raise more than US$ 10 billion. US$ 2.28 next month. However, although default looks almost like a certainty, it\u00b4s important to raise some considerations here. Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's Government does not want to default on its debt, because eviction is something that could follow right after that. So, self-preservation has a heavy weight here. Thus, what I believe that is going to happen is that Venezuela will continue to swap part of its gold reserves (US$ 16.4 billion) to meet its debt obligation at the same time that will force import contraction. It\u00b4s important to notice that Maduro is trying to pass an economic emergency decree in Congress, which was refused, so far, by opposition. Anyways, it seems to be too late and too little, but it would certainly buy him some time. Moreover, Maduro is pushing for an OPEC meeting in February to try to raise oil prices. Finally, China, Russia and now Iran (thanks to the end of the economic embargo) could bail out Venezuela with another loan.
