Boko Harem is contained, international help is underway etc.; so, paradoxically, media coverage on the subject could be a sign for preventing famine.\n\t\u00a0\nI also would like to comment on @boz comment: https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/494347\n\u00b7 The first two points point to Nigeria's reputation and influence\u2026 I am not sure about the preferences of Nigerias Gov since it could also help Nigeria to have a famine declaration by the UN (resources, help, media coverage concerning a problem they cannot handle due to their failing and failed states characteristics; and democratic norm may not hinder the declaration of a humanitarian catastrophe); I am also not sure whether they have so much influence to prevent a declaration.\n\u00b7 The third point on resources goes both ways as @boz admits.\n\u00b7 The points on FEWSNET are striking, however.\n\u00b7 The last point on the UN is a little overdrawn. However, it could well be that the UN is trying to avoid a noisy declaration, i.e. that is not valid - as I pointed out above.\n\t\u00a0\nAll in all: it is a very hard question. Given the momentum of the situation to become worse and worse, the chances are above the 50 percent threshold. But it is far from certain. My guess is that we are around 66 to 80 percent.\nThe most serious problem is that we seem to know very little on how the decision processes on famine declaration are organized and which stakeholders do a power play, which preferences they have, how much salience these preference have to them and how much influence they can have\u2026 \nAlso we lack the understanding of the dynamics of famine crisis, e.g.: How likely is it that a famine can be prevented once it was diagnosed as (very) likely to happen and thereby mobilizing international help to prevent it?\n\t\u00a0\n--> Does anyone have ideas on that?"], [1034, "2017-05-19T07:54:07Z", 1.0, "Allen-Ebrahimian, B.
