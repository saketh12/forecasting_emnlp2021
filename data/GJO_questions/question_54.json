A formal invitation will likely come at the summit meeting in Warsaw next year as has been alluded to by the Polish Defense Minister who was speaking on the matter at a recent Investment Summit in Warsaw on Sept. 24th. However, a decision to extend a formal invitation could occur in December as a number of forecasters have noted below. There is reasonably strong support for inclusion, it is \"low hanging fruit\" and Vladimir has only hastened the process. Counter that with the refugee crisis and rather tepid support amongst the citizenry. Again, as noted below, may we have some clarity as to what constitutes resolution here?

But as others (particularly dominich) have pointed out, a formal invitation is something different, made at a higher-level meeting.
