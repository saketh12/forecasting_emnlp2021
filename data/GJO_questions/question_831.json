While it is a terror hotbed, it is a stable one and the groups that have significant influence would not allow any deviance from that stability. I leave my answer as high as 5% because of ISIS' presence in their \"Khorasan Province\" just across the border in Afghanistan, and there is a chance that they could do something violent and crazy as their parent organization did in Iraq and Syria, but there have not been massacres in Afghanistan and it is highly unlikely there will start to be, or that there would be some that spilled over into Afghanistan.
