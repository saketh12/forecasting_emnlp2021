The members of the Fed are well aware of that. If the Fed does hike rates now, it will be for political reasons, not economic ones, and the political pressure is to raise rates. Is there a political downside to keeping rates low? As Larry Wilmore repeatedly points out, \"Obama don't care;\" i.e., political consequences aren't important to the administration anymore. So that's a point against rate hikes. The Federal Open Market Committee operates by consensus rather than vote tally, a process that generally tends to insulate individuals in a group from retaliation.
