Ambition: Biden is an intensely ambitious man whose sole objective has been the presidency. Evidence: Biden is the only U.S. senator who has never accumulated a fortune; never sought or received a lucrative private equity/investment or consulting or lobbying position; never sought to cash in on his fame via five- or six-figure lectures or million-dollar book royalties, or any other profit-seeking venture. He is 100% a political animal, perhaps the last remaining such figure in our national political life.\n2. He has plenty of time to win: the notion that it's too late to enter and win is unsupported by logic or evidence. First, Biden's campaign apparatus can easily and rapidly raise money, and in any case his name recognition is already high enough that he needs less advertising spend than any other candidate, in either party.  Secondly, it is the Democratic Party's superdelegates, not the Party rank-and-file voters, who determine the nominee. These are ruthlessly pragmatic professionals who simply want to win the presidency. Most have no particular loyalty to the Clintons. More than a few are intensely loyal to Obama, and still harbor bitter feelings over the 2008 race. These superdelegates would gladly switch to Obama's most loyal ally (and his likely designated heir).\n3. Biden's model here is Bobby Kennedy (RFK), another high-profile executive branch figure who jumped into the race in March 1968 and quickly vaulted to the forefront - even though Kennedy was a far more divisive and controversial figure. Like Biden, RFK had zero interest in money and was motivated instead by lifelong, burning ambition, stoked in part by personal resentment of a Democratic rival. Biden probably does not resent the Clintons to anywhere near the degree that RFK hated Lyndon Johnson, but he is a politician through and through. Biden knows that he is a far better politician than Hillary Clinton and that he was the force behind most of the major achievements of the Obama administration (including the extraordinarily successful rescue of GM, the prevention of financial collapse, and the passage of the stimulus bill in the face of Republican obstructionism). The party's superdelegates also know that Hillary is a weak candidate with no better than a 50-50 chance of defeating Rubio or Bush, both of whom Biden would easily defeat through a combination of very high African-American turnout and white working-class support across Ohio, the rest of the industrial heartland and the other battleground states. \nBiden wants the presidency, and he will announce well before Thanksgiving. 75% odds that he announces by noontime ET Monday Nov. 2."], [102, "2015-10-17T17:31:49Z", 1.0, "Some common sense.
