While the Taliban have gained strength and presense in conservative areas of Afghanistan (predominantly in the Pashto speaking areas), they have lacked the large scale deaths that would result in a yes answer so far. ISIL remains a growing threat in Aghanistan, but the US role in degrading and destroying ISIL does include ISIL elements/groups outside of Iraq and Syria and, again, ISIL haven't yet committed large scale deaths that would result in a yes answer. of course, the typical spring and summer offensives that characterise the fighting in Afghanistan may alter the siutation. the size and capability of groups remains a significant barrier and will this will likely continue to be the case.

Although there are constant battles in Afghanistan, they are between Islamic extremist groups.  Historically, Afghanistan is a place countries and Islamic sects want to rule rather than destroy.  That fact is good for the Afghani people because genocide typically takes place in areas the offenders are going to leave after the fact.  Whichever government, sect, or terrorist group ends up in power in Afghanistan will need some cooperation from the people, and genocide would hurt their chance to maintain power.  I believe no Afghani armed group will engage in a campaign that systematically kills 1,000 or more civilians in Afghanistan before April 1, 2018.

Now, due to its high birth-rate the population keeps growing, still imagine having 51.3 years of live expectancy, and a birth rate of 38.1 per 1000 or 300% of the US!  \nSpecifically, looking at the total casualties in Afghanistan we are at: 25 639  for 2016 and consistent with the 2015 pattern, those are recognized deaths due to the conflict, it also relates to the drug trade. It is a fact that becoming a mercenary (anything related to the armed conflict)  or a drug trader are the two most popular employment solutions to earn some decent money with young afghans. \nConsidering that the religious battles at this point are just an excuse to control the drug trade from Kabul, the escalation in the civilian casualties in large scale will evolve from large amount of action and the casualties from small numbers will surmount to the trend.\nIf we are going to see a major event of 1000 plus casualties as a routine, the risk provability will be higher in the areas of Nangarhar, Logar  and Patkia where the illegal trade is higher and the Pasthu power structure collides in many fronts.   \nThe US has allowed the drug lords to continue to control large parts of the central government and allow then to keep their turf as long as they collaborate. I can see the continuation of attacks going forward but none to the size to reach 1000 from a single actor, deaths in Afghanistan will reach well above 19 000 in 2017, this is part of the piss-off game to control heroin and religious retrogrades among the drug-lords.
