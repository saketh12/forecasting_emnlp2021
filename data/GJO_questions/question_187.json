That sets the trend - less need for imports, growing leadership in technological energy (not fuel-based i.e. oil / gas), and side effects of less CO2 in the long-run (city-smog). Remember - technology costs reduce with time e.g. Swanson's law, extractive costs increase. Key lesson China taking to heart. See for example, and then follow the lines of reasoning :  http://blogs.ft.com/nick-butler/2016/04/18/will-china-transform-the-worlds-energy-market/\nEV growth fits squarely into this strategic long game - specific target, they are investing in subsidies for infrastructure as well as EVs, and they are making EVs quickly and cheaply, so definition of EV may get stretched, but world will catch on that making good-enough EV and quick infrastructure build is the way to make any state - not just China - capable of generating key baseload of energy from technology and not imported fuel. See anything in the last 2 years by Bloomberg New Energy finance. As an aside. this is potentially ideology-free energy development (e.g. solar / wind aggressive investment in - wait for it - Texas). As solar / wind reach tipping point for cost / MWh, as they have in certain areas, commercial scale electricity from solar / wind will increasingly be seen as technological-based energy, not fuel-based. Once erected, solar / wind projects are essentially fuel free, they are modular so pay-back can be relatively quick, and they benefit from technology learning / cost curves, unlike extractive fuel projects, except in certain countries, or fracking in US which benefits from the same technology improvements over time via repetition.
