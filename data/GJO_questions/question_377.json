I guess Trump would need to give then a few weeks to think about it. If they agree then months or years of negotiations would follow so the answer to this question with 0%. If  they say no then step 2 could be threatening to give notice, they would need to be given time to think about it. If they now agree to negotiate the answer to the question is 0%. If they still don't agree then notice could be given. \nSo the issues are (a) will Canada and Mexico agree to negotiate (b) if they don't will Trump write the letter  and does he need Congress to agree (c) if it comes to triggering the latter how long will it all take. \nIf I was involved on the Mexican or Canadian side I would be seriously worried about the US withdrawing from NAFTA. Faced with the threat of the US withdrawing I would aim to prevaricate. The NAFTA agreement appears to be a fairly complex trade agreement with lots of sections covering issues that could be regarded as favorable to US interests as well as things that are favorable to Mexican or Canadian interests.  If  negotiations are started no doubt all three countries will press for more favorable terms for their special interests, so renegotiation could quite easily be dragged out for years as all the special interest groups weigh in with demands that they want their governments to fight for. Unilaterally withdrawing would harm all three countries and cross border businesses. Trump might threaten to rip up the deal. but my guess is that it would be big risk to US business. \nSo my conclusion is that before 30th April 2017 Canada and Mexico will agree to talk about re-negotiating NAFTA. As its unclear if Trump has the power to trigger article 2205 and (to me) its unclear if he writes the letter if he can withdraw it within the 6 months, it therefore seems unlikely that it the letter will be sent before 30th April.  \nSome numbers; agree to negotiate with no specific threats before  30th April 80%, Not agree to negotiate and are threatened with 2205 20%, agree to negotiate under threat of 2205  20%.
