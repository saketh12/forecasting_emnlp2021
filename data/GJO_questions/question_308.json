Thus, we may assume for this prediction that Iran is continuously seeking to increase its total revenue, to secure itself as a socially, politically and militarily powerful international actor. The first graph indicates that Iran\u2019s main source of revenue is oil with only 11 percent of its GDP being obtained otherwise (fig. 1). Additionally, to further understand the importance of oil to the economy of Iran, recent studies have shown that since the lifting of the P5 imposed sanctions on Iran in 2016 - initially imposed due to its threatening nuclear program (Labott, 2015) \u2013 its oil exports have tripled (Egan, 2017). With a current crude oil production of approximately 3.8 million barrels per day (bpd) (fig. 2), researchers seek to find out whether Iran\u2019s monthly oil production will exceed the 4 million bpd mark by the beginning of 2018. The following will provide an insight into whether these numbers are actually achievable. \n \tAccording to the senior consultant of research for JBC Energy, these numbers are only achievable if Iran\u2019s technological capacities to extract crude oil are modernized (Egan, 2017). Relying heavily on foreign interest, Iran has therefore composed the Iran Petroleum Contract. Its terms state that there will be an increase in profits obtainable by foreign investors and the guarantee of revenue due to a newly developed risk service (Willn, 2015). Herewith, Iran is aiming to cover its issue of outdated extracting technology: a profound hurdle to achieving reach the newly set mark. However, as argued by O\u2019Donnell, not all terms have been \u2018spelled out\u2019 fully yet, due to Iran\u2019s fear of foreign investments causing troubles in regards to social security through instances such as job-loss for local workers etc. (Egan, 2017).\n \tIt is important to note however that Iran has strong geostrategic interests in the Middle East, especially in regards to the sectarian war in Syria (Gause, 2017). Simply put, more investments imply greater oil revenues and greater oil revenues lead to more money: a needed means for the feasibility of Iran\u2019s geostrategic interests. As Iran is ranked by the CIA as the 16th most prominent international oil exporter its exports are far below those of its competitors Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (\"The World Factbook \u2014 Central Intelligence Agency\", 2017). Thus, in order to boost its power in and over unstable parts of the region, I would like to stress that it will be unlikely for Iran to oppose foreign interest. In fact, only recently Iran has \u201cvowed to increase\u201d oil exports to buyers in the European Union (Levit, 2017)., providing an insight into its willingness to rise through the ranks and to turn a blind eye to possible social security issues.\n \tIn sum, the outdated infrastructure and technology to extract crude oil are leading Iran to attract foreign investors. With an influx of investors, the country is promised an increase in oil production, and foremost an increase in profit. Even though the presence of foreign companies may imply precarious working conditions for the Iranian oil labourers, Iran\u2019s geostrategic interests display that Iran may be willing to overlook this social issue. Additionally, as the current number of barrels produced per month has already reached 3.8 million \u2013 and noting that we are only in the first third of 2017 \u2013 we may assume Iran to be exceeding the 4 million mark before the end of the year."], [24109, "2017-03-31T04:31:01Z", 0.7, "Trend increase of 50k bpd per month.
