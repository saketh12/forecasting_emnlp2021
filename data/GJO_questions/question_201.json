Since 1947 civilian governments have lasted respectively 11 years, 6 years and 11 years again before being overthrown by the military. So Pakistan's history suggests the possibility of a coup in the next few years. Lets start by assuming an even money chance of a coup sometime in the next four years. The allegations of corruption against Sharif's family suggest that a coup, if it is to happen, will more than likely occur for a publicly justifiable reason, and is therefore most likely in the remaining months of 2016, though early 2017 is still quite possible. Lets say that if it happens its an 80% chance of occurring in 2016. That lowers my assessment of the odds to 50%*80%=40%. However history also suggests that democracy is taking hold-2013 gave Pakistan the first civilian transfer of power after the successful completion of a five year term by a democratically elected government. Presumably also the military has a weather eye on the chaos that has ensued in the middle east after the overthrow of governments, albeit not democratic ones. I will arbitrarily calculate that each of these factors halves the potential risks and bring my forecast down to 40%*1/2*1/2=10%. The next  factor to consider is Sharif pledging to resign if found to be corrupt. At the moment he has plausible deniability as the allegations concern his family and not him. I believe that an inquiry will be under international pressure to keep Pakistan's democracy on track for fear of Pakistan's nuclear capabilities. Basis this I'll leave the odds where they are. However a couple of other possibilities to consider are 1) Sharif personally getting implicated as more documents are revealed and 2) Sharif being the victim of a plane crash, bombing or even his death from natural causes.

This constrains the preference set to a small number of choices and consequently, with one outcome (leaving office), preferences over choices are an extremely small set.  Since corruption, patronage and de facto military/ruling elite coalition are prominent features of the Pakistani polity, one should expect that the PM's minimum winning coalition will remain in tact.    Therefore, given the function, g: X --> A  choices under conditions of certainty, require that {a1, ...., a(k)} be mapped topologically as one member of A to the outcome set X. X = {x1, ...,  x(n)}.  this constraint requires that the conditional action or choice in a maximized choice set suggest that the only option that would result in an outcome of the PM leaving office, is when he no longer has the support of the minimum winning coalition in the polity.   If this conditional outcome requires a negative action (or choice) compared to the previous preference, then the outcome will suggest a likely possibility that the PM will leave office.  However, given that the PM leaving office requires a choice set of A = {coercion, loss of a minimum coalition, and significant threat toward the PM}, this would be analytically and theoretically support leaving office.  However, given that corruption in Pakistan is deeply ingrained in its polity and the Panama Papers revelation has been open knowledge in Pakistan for some time, we can deduce with a high degree of confidence that the PM will not leave office.
