A decade later, thanks in part to the introduction of smartphones and tablets, internet access across the country has increased enormously (best estimate for 2016 is that more than 65% of the population have regular, domestic access, with more able to access the internet through public or shared facilities); in 2014, approximately 50% of Iranians had accessed, or were regularly accessing, social media platforms 'illegally'. Notably, senior members of the Iranian regime are avid users of social media themselves (President Rouhani, for instance, has two twitter accounts, and regularly posts 'selfies'). It is clear, therefore, that the 2006 ban is an anachronism which no longer fits contemporary Iranian society. As a result, powerful figures within the Iranian government have called for the ban to be partially lifted. Rouhani is seen as a moderniser, who is more likely than his conservative predecessors to relax the ban to a degree. Moreover, the Iranian regime clearly appreciates the power of social media as a propaganda tool, both against the West, and against rising Sunni militancy in the Middle East (which is thought of as a direct threat to Shia Iran), and is keen to harness its power in that regard.

There is definitely a change visible in the urban areas (house parties are common, and self made spirits as well, Facebook is widely used), which is seen as problematic on the side of orthodox Islamist. Although Facebook and Twitter is widely used (also by Ruhani), the ban at least pretends a kind of balance of power (something similar to the situation of gays in the US army years ago: don't ask, don't tell). If they would cut it, it might lead to a vow through the conservatives which could fear that they loose power.
