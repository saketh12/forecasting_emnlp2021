They are also preventable. \"\nBut what is predicted below are terrorist attacks :(. \nAnother miss and probably biggest mistake is Indians is not single identity like US/Australia/UK etc. the apt comparison for India should be EU, with each state having its own identity & culture. \nin such a diverse environment no one will be able to sense the local opinions and moods from living in another part of the country. if possible split the question in to sub section of India then it would be possible to have realistic predictions.
