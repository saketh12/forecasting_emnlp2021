The purpose of having any any policy written into a constitution is to prevent law makers easily changing laws in that area. It appears from opinion polls that most Irish voters think that there are circumstance where abortion should be permitted and there are circumstances where most think it should not be permitted. As has been pointed out there is considerable disagreement between voters as to what these circumstances should be. It would be reasonable to speculate that the opinions of voters would vary over time as different circumstances get fuller discussion and that science presents new facts. It is surely impossible to expect a constitution to be able to define all circumstances, which is why democracies have legislators who pass laws that fit the circumstances and the needs of the time and can be changed to fit the circumstances and needs of tomorrow or next year. Removing the Eighth Amendment would not be a vote for a free for all over abortion, but a vote to allow legislators to adapt to needs. If voters really do  not trust politicians to make good laws, it difficult to hold out much hope for democracy, they might as well hand over government to a dictator or require a referendum on every law. It appears that in the last twenty years or so Irish citizens have become more confident that they have a right (and duty) to vote for representatives that will carry out the people's wishes rather than as happened in the past, the citizen was expected to be constrained and directed by higher authorities.

The referendum on gay marriage inspires hope that they will be more progressive on this issue, but in places like Roscommon the vote was very close, and the country is looking at a deep divide on the issue between what could be considered the old guard and the newer generations that see abortion as a reproductive right.
