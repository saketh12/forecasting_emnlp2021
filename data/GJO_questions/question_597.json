This alone makes it unlikely for a dispute to arise.

Except for one month where Iran had too much heavy water because the US refused to buy it like they agreed to, Iran has been completely in compliance with the treaty. The only reason why there would be a contested site is if Trump is looking for a reason for a conflict, but I think it's just as likely that Trump would pull us out of the treaty altogether. I believe any contested site would be a false flag accusation. The last few decades has had scores of those. While I do think it is likely the US will go to war soon in order to distract the public and because the powers-that-be believe it stimulates the economy, I think it is more likely to be with North Korea or Russia or Venezuela.
