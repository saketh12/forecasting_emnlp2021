It's not 100% certain if they will choose to do so again, as this depends on the systematic and targeted nature of the killings related to the drug war.

There is no doubt that local police and national military and law enforcement personnel have killed more than enough people to make their quota under this Q, and will continue to do so.  This is a national campaign, conducted at the instruction or with the approval of the President of the Republic.  The fact that he uses various agencies in different parts of the country to murder people should not, in my not-very-humble opinion, mean he and minions are off the hook for the murders of thousands of civilians.  "], [34353, "2017-09-29T17:47:43Z", 0.01, "Given the definitions and criteria above, this (in my opinion) is really either 1% or 100%. The police have killed over 2,000 civilians in the campaign against drug traffickers. Whether that is an armed group engaging in a campaign policy that knowingly results in widespread civilian deaths is something the administrators will have to clarify. Considering that the question is being asked, I assume that the answer is no given that it is not a specific civilian group being targeted, but rather an ambiguous \"drug dealer\" group defined by the civilian population and the police. Without clarification if the drug war (and the subsequent targeting of \"drug dealers\") meets the definition above, it's unlikely this will be resolved as a yes. Additionally, the lack of clarity by the government and police forces makes it difficult to assess whether its a campaign by an armed group against civilians. Therefore, I assess this as 1%, as there is no major campaign happening between armed forces that would reach this level."]]}
