After the record NEC meeting (~15 hours), Ramaphosa returned to Zuma to convey the decision that he needs to resign (again).  Zuma steadfastly refuses.  Given the following issues, the crises is still ripe for conflict.  Zuma is supported by at least close to half, and the largest number of ANC members in the organization.  This has a likelihood of the following:  Zuma leaving when chooses, creating his own party (as stated repeatedly), and the ANC will split down its center at all levels, including its highest political structures.   This creates a serious dilemma for Ramaphosa;  he will govern with a weak power base with strong collective opposition in an unofficial coalition between Zuma and center left parties in parliament.  More urgently, we can expect a significant increase in the levels of violence in the country in the short term accompanied by assassinations on a level not previously seen, capital flight, depreciation of the Rand and unstable investment potentials in the near and long term.  Chaos on the parliamentary front can be expected, a possibility of an entire cabinet resigning under the scenarios of a no confidence vote or impeachment proceedings and or legal maneuvers.  The legal dilemma the organization faces is the following:  Zuma remains the president of the country, distinct from or despite his role in the party and the insistence by the NWC/NEC demands.  Ramaphosa, as head of the party is in no legal or constitutional position to force removal or resignation, despite organizational recall.  Zuma may constitutionally remove Ramaphosa as Vice President despite his position as head of the party.

Remains to be seen if the pressure would work - I suppose the ANC leadership wants Zuma to announce his departure in the State of the Union speech on Feb 8. If he doesn't budge, the ANC would face a difficult choice - remove him via a divisive vote of no confidence, or not remove him (cancel the vote, or vote against).

Their judgement has provided a broad opening for Zuma;  the speaker of parliament, determined by the court must make her own determination about whether to hold a secret ballot.  Mbete, one the core 6  leaders of the ANC will undoubtedly argue for transparency and an open vote.  While this move seems innocuous, it provides ANC MP's (who view their duty to the party as foundational, and to society as secondary) with a high probability vote against the no confidence vote in Zuma.  A myriad of factors account for strict voting blocs within parties, in this case, understates the role of intimidation, threats and assassination squads against party members who do not tow the party line.  There has been a worrisome increase in the number of assassinated leaders, both intra and interparty in recent years ~ 3 -4 years.  Ideological shifts from the proscribed 'democratic centralism', a Leninist view of the role between party, state and power consolidation, remains a cornerstone of the 'South African democratic model.'  These views are a strong ideological holdover of the Stalinist and Leninist influence when the party was banned, its members and leaders in exile, and the positioning of their cadre training in the former Soviet Union, East Germany, Cuba, Angola and the myriad cohort support by autocratic and dictatorial regimes, notwithstanding the role of the SACP and global support by anti apartheid activists unaware of the  rooted views of communism.  While some believe in the correctness of their decisions, the primacy of the party and its unity moving into the December elections are paramount.  Despite Mbete's previous declaration of impartiality, she is a Zuma ally.

Zuma is facing allegations of corruptions, discontent of governance performance (especially poor economic performance), and growing discontent within the ranks of the ANC. So far, he has been able to deter challenges to his grip on the ANC, thus the presidency, but the ever increasing problems he faces are building to a critical mass. Ironically, it is in trying to contain those growing problems that he will lose the presidency. In effect, through the effort of plying different stakeholders within his base of support, that is the ANC leadership and constituency, Zuma will have to either engage in deal-making or demagoguery, and both options have their drawbacks. If it is the former, the ANC leadership is not monolithic and is composed of diverse personalities and interests, all of which are jockeying for the aftermath of Zuma's presidency and if Zuma empowers one to the detriment of others, the ones left out will coalesce against him. For the latter, if Zuma attempts the demagogue route and engages in stocking racial and social tensions to keep power, he will alienate the leadership of the ANC and also incur a challenge from the far left.
