In other words demands that social media companies are treated in a similar way to publishers.\nIn many respects this is to be expected as most types of new media are, in their early days, accused of disturbing society. Eventually laws are enacted to control the perceived abuses as society navigates it way between freedom of expression and censorship. \nThe difference with today's social media is that the scale of posts will make it very expensive for the sites to use people to judge if complainants have good cause to demand removal of offending posts . Eventually AI may be able provide editorial oversight. In the meantime governments that prioritize the rights of those who think they are being damaged by illegal content will not be very interested in how difficultly or expensive it is for the social media sites to control user content, and will fine the social media sites until they comply with new contend laws. \nObviously I do not know what the social media sites will do about it (e.g. they may be forced to \"know your customers\" so that the authorities can prosecute the users who post illegal material, or so that they can be sued by wronged people, or the social media sites may need the means of banning users that do not follow the rules, the social media may need to block different  posts in different legal jurisdictions.)
