Many may want to attempt to make it to Europe.\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Turkey received several billions to \u201ckeep\u201d and \u201cprevent\u201d sailings to Greece. Sadly, little action has been seen thus far.\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sweden closed it borders as well as Denmark.\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Germany is discussing limiting to 200 k/a, something in this direction will happen, especially after the events in Cologne.\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lastly, for 1 million to be breached we need 83k/m. What are the odds?\n\u00a0\nSome opinions:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To me Europe, the EU and the people are slowly getting sick of this issue and will try to do as much as possible to limit the influx. How, is much disputed, but without action the right-wing populist will win more seats and force action. With the \u201cgood times\u201d over, as at least in Germany the life of a typical refugee is not all that prosperous as maybe thought, the economically motived refugees should become less. Why spend 10k\u20ac on travels to get 120\u20ac/m pocket money?\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Woman and children. Officially 58% were men, but likely it was more, meaning there extended family, once granted asylum are likely to follow. 1 wife and 3-5 kids per man = 2.9 million potential entries\u2026but the key thing is, they will likely be flown in, if they are allowed in. In Germany, it take between 6-24 months to have the status approved, meaning very few families will be transferred in 2016, thus voiding this aspect in light of the GJOpen question\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Turkey as a Nato nation, aspiring EU nation and Germany is their main trading partner, pressure to keep there word will be mounting. They most slow down the influx, if only by 50% it still is significant.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Weather, winter has not yet truly hit Europe allowing more than typical /expected entrees in Q4-2015. Should a harsh Q1-2016 winter hit, \u00a0it will slow movement and allow governments to prepare for the rest of the year\n\u00a0\nAll-in-all:\nMaintaining 83k/m is unlikely. Yet, as long as Merkel maintains a \u201cwelcome\u201d policy many will be motived. Let us consider that all the 1.7 million in Turkey plus another million from nieghbouring countries will join, plus 0.2 from North Africa. Total: 2.9 million. Now, I have listed 6 major points why it should be throttled.

And unless another single country contributes nearly 500,000 refugees in 2016, OR there is a sharp uptick in the sum of multiple not-Syrian refugees, I don't see this 1M threshold being crossed again. Second, I predict at the behest of EU and UN leaders, broader international support will unfold; even small levels of aid from around the world will absorb a significant a portion of the Mediterranean traffic, and I expect these mechanisms will be greased before 3Q (warmer) months.
