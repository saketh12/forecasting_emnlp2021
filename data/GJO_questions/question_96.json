[Edit: And for those who suggest that French SF may have already been there, I would suggest an increased tempo and scope as to their activities.] I could place some probability on the first step, but taking Le Drian's \"hint\" as a confirmation, and for computational simplicity, I'm just going to assume it to be \"yes.\" The aforementioned is just a long way of saying we are faced with forecasting the probability that these (assumed to be) deployed troops will be reported upon. This is challenging because, except for very rare glimpses, it is a controlled information environment.\n- French \"long-standing policy of never discussing the deployment of its elite troops.\" Certainly an excellent operational security policy and one that would likely be respected by the vast majority of Western news sources and outlets.\n+ The assumption that LeDrian is sophisticated enough to recognize that even a \"hint\" is a violation of that policy, which therefore requires the additional assumption that LeDrian had some sufficient reason to violate that policy. Would the desire to generate a signal of coalition solidarity be sufficient reason? Is there some perceived need to demonstrate some active effort to a domestic audience? Perhaps this reason, whatever it may be, will continue.\n+ There are some reputable non-Western sources and outlets who may have an independent interest in the report; which can only now be enhanced by, perhaps, the professional ambition of some intrepid journalist to pop the \"hint\" bubble that Le Drian has created.\n- The nature of the activities are covert, often in \"the dark\" both figuratively and literally. Not a lot of free-floating witnesses who don't have their back turned to the action as they are running away. Also, maybe the \"hint\" indicates the French SF are embedded within some U.S. SF group(s), making distinctive identification difficult.\n+/- The one perhaps relevant incident we have is that of a Canadian special force contingent. No news was generated by this contingent until they were placed under a crazy banzai-like attack (my description) by ISIL.
