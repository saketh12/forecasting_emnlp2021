This highlights the fact that an offensive on a city as far north as Mosul will require security of supply lines and efforts to minimize gaps that would facilitate ISIL counter-attacks. Mosul is predominately Sunni, and this requires a delicate and patient approach to free a city inhabited by people that are weary of the Shiite militias and the Shia dominated central Iraqi government. Kurdish forces, who are closer to the city might be held back by economic hardships brought on by low oil prices and lower budgeting from the Iraqi central government.

Jack Reed, a Democrat from Rhode Island and the ranking Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said of the CTS troops.\nBut, the senator added, they risk being worn out by overuse.\nThe elite forces recently led the way in taking back Ramadi from militants affiliated with the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS and earlier spearheaded the offensive to recapture Tikrit when conventional Iraqi troops and Shia militias backed by Iran failed. They held on at the Baiji oil refinery when others fled and recently routed ISIS in fighting near Haditha in western Anbar province, according to U.S. and Iraqi officials.\n\"They are beginning to prepare for other efforts to retake territory\" from ISIS, said Reed, who recently returned from Iraq and meetings with U.S. and Iraqi commanders.\n\"One of the major objectives is Mosul,\" he said, but \"that's probably months and months away\" in the campaign against ISIS.\nJoint Chiefs Chairman Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford said the U.S. was looking at ways to speed up the timeline for commencing operations in Mosul. In Paris on Sunday, Dunford told reporters traveling with him that he will soon make recommendations to President Barack Obama on the possible repositioning of U.S. troops in northern Iraq to aid an assault on Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city.\n\"We're about winning\" and \"we want to have the Iraqis win,\" he said.\nThe repositioning would involve placing U.S. advisors closer to Mosul than the Joint Operations Center in Irbil, capital of the Kurdish autonomous region, according to a Defense Department news release.\n\"It is fair to say we will have positions -- we already do (in Irbil) -- up in the north that will facilitate supporting Iraqi security forces as they isolate Mosul,\" Dunford said after meetings with Gen. Pierre de Villiers, chief of France's defense staff.\nFor the Iraqi Security Forces, the push north from Baiji up the Tigris River valley to Mosul will require more Iraqi troops and more U.S. soldiers to train them for a major operation, Army Col. Steve Warren, a spokesman for Combined Joint Task Force-Operation Inherent Resolve, said in a briefing to the Pentagon from Baghdad last week.\n\"Hundreds, not thousands\" of additional U.S. troops will have to be deployed for the training assignment, he said. \"The reason we need new trainers or additional trainers is because that's really the next step in generating the amount of combat power needed to liberate Mosul.\"\nWarren added, \"We know we will need more (Iraqi) brigades to be trained, we'll need more troops trained in more specialties\" to liberate Mosul, the largest city controlled by ISIS.\nIt was impossible to know how many ISIS fighters were defending Mosul, but Warren said the estimates run from 5,000 to 10,000. To take back the city, the second largest in Iraq, \"We think we're going to need, you know, in the neighborhood of eight trained brigades\" of about 3,000 troops each, he said, \"but that's adjustable.\"\nIn Ramadi, three brigades of Iraqi Security Forces were used but only after the Counter-Terrorism Service troops cleared the way into the city. The troops threw up a pontoon bridge across the Euphrates River after ISIS militants blew the existing bridges. The elite forces then attacked to the city center, using bulldozers to throw up earth berms on either side of the advance to block ISIS suicide truck bombers on their flanks, Warren said.\nThe Ramadi assault followed a pattern of Iraqi attack -- CTS troops lead the way, conventional ISF forces conduct clearing operations, and Iraqi National Police, and on occasion Sunni tribal fighter, provide continuing security for rebuilding efforts.\nWhen Ramadi was retaken, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said that Mosul also would be retaken in 2016. \"We are coming to liberate Mosul, which will be the fatal blow to\" ISIS, he said.\nIn the north, Fuad Hussein, chief of staff of the Kurdish Peshmerga forces, said his troops were ready for the push on Mosul but were awaiting the arrival of the Counter-Terrorism Service and Iraqi Security Forces.\n\"We had [a] discussion to liberate Mosul last year in March, and now we're in January 2016. So it has been delayed,\" Hussein told the Kurdish Rudaw news service last week. \"The question is why? To be honest it has to do with the Iraqis -- we need a partner.\"\nHussein praised the professionalism of the elite CTS troops. \"That unit has good fighters and are well organized and has a lot of experience,\" he said, \"So we need them to be with us as partners so that we can jointly, with the American help, liberate Mosul.\"\nSince the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, the CTS, which was created by the U.S., has received the most training and the best equipment from the U.S., which recognized their unique role in the Iraqi national security structure as a relatively independent and non-sectarian fighting force.\nTo avoid political influence that plagues other units, the Counter-Terrorism Service reports directly to the prime minister, rather than going through the Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Interior.\nIn a paper on the elite troops for the Brookings Institution, retired Army Special Operations Col. David Witty, said, \"Organizations such as CTS are at the heart of U.S. strategies in the Middle East that aim to develop indigenous capacity to combat insurgents and terrorists.\"\nAfter ISIS invaded Iraq and took Mosul in 2014, \"five of Iraq's 14 Army divisions were rated as ineffective, or had disappeared completely. U.S. advisers rated remaining units as infiltrated with Shia militias and Sunni extremists. At the other extreme, the Counter-Terrorism Service was assessed as the one bright spot of ISF. It was the best military organ,\" Witty said.\nThe elite unit \"was able to maintain its cohesion and effectiveness, despite experiencing some of the most intensive combat, suffering heavy losses, and continuing to be used as a regular, although elite, ISF unit, rather than in a dedicated counter-terrorism role,\" Witty said.\nIn a round table session with reporters earlier this month, Sen. Reed said of the service, \"We need to have capable forces fighting alongside them, and that's the goal, and we are trying to train up those forces now.\""], [755, "2016-01-28T00:15:10Z", 0.25, "A great opinion piece stating the Iraqi Army is far from ready to conduct a major combat operation against Mosul:\nThe National Interest, January 25, 'The Long Road to Fallujah and Mosul': http://nationalinterest.org/feature/the-long-road-fallujah-mosul-15018\nRemember, the invasion of Europe in 1944 was years in it's planning and execution.

ISIS is likely to be a formidable foe against an Iraqi Army that has proven itself highly ineffective.  There are few other players that seem keen on getting involved that may hasten an ISIS defeat in Mosul.  Turkey has not demonstrated any interest in defeating ISIS since its primary concern is the Kurds.  And, the Kurds are preoccupied with defending its interests against Turkey, so they would likely only get involved reluctantly.  Additionally, neither the American people nor the Obama administration has the willingness to invest the ground forces required to defeat and destroy ISIS.  Finally, the wealthy Gulf/Arab countries have done little to date to help defeat ISIS.  With all that in mind, there seems to be little willingness or ability among any of the likely players to rush into re-taking Mosul before the end of the year in what would undoubtedly be a costly and brutal campaign.

First, it took the Iraqi military seven long months \u2014 since May 2015 \u2014 to make progress into the central neighborhoods of the city. Since the past summer, with the help of the US Air Force, Baghdad has been repeatedly unable to dislodge IS militants. A state military force deploying the latest weapons, operationally supported by the United States with air cover and, reportedly, ground troops, accompanied by Iran\u2019s top military commanders, US-armed tribesmen and led by vengeful sectarian militias has been haphazardly fighting for more than half a year for a mid-size city 100 kilometers (60 miles) from Baghdad that it should not have lost in the first place and which was seized as an afterthought by a nonstate armed group that had already won the prize in Mosul.\nSecond, since Ramadi has been declared \"liberated,\" IS has stepped up its urban guerrilla tactics with deadly results for the elite Iraqi troops. Observer tribesmen claim that the group still controls a third of the city, and there are reports of neighborhoods with the IS flag flying within a hundred meters of the national troops. In the midst of a devastated city, we are at best looking at a prolonged tit-for-tat phase of factional advance-and-retreat cycles previously witnessed elsewhere, notably in Fallujah. In truth, the price paid by the Iraqi military and the US forces in Ramadi is already too high. The strategy they worked on for the past months is now known to IS, which wasted no time in switching in situ to suicide-attack mode and withdrew its fighters to \"stretch the enemy,\" keeping them in expectation of a possible counterattack. There are already indications of the Iraqi authorities overplaying their hand with statements that IS will be defeated in 2016 and Mosul is next.\nFinally, and most revealingly, Ramadi is arguably not that important for IS.

Many of the other commentators have done a good job of analyzing the difficulties the Iraqi Army will have in rapidly shifting from Ramadi to Mosul to take Mosul by 1 Jan.  After they finish Ramadi, which will take a few months more to consolidate, the IA will then have to lick its wounds and prepare for the next operation.  (and everything will slow down for the summer) While they say that the next operation is Mosul, and the US is certainly pressuring them to go for Mosul, they will have a decision point.  There is one strategic factor about this decision point that I have not seen discussed.  The Baghdad government has no incentive to remove threats against the Kurds.  As soon as the Iraqi Army retakes Mosul, then Barzani and the KRG are safe from the ISIL threat, meaning that they then have fewer constraints on \"misbehavior\" (from Baghdad's perspective): actions that promote KRG independence, just like they were doing before the fall of Mosul.  So why would Baghdad sacrifice Shia blood to remove a threat to the KRG before they have to? So it seems doubtful that they will put a lot of pressure from the top to make the operation happen quickly.  And to make it happen before 1 Jan 17 would require a lot of command pressure to overcome the Iraqi's army's risk aversion, organizational problems, force generation, overcoming losses, etc.\nOn the other hand, I bumped my prediction back up from a low around 5-10% to account for the non-zero chance of a rapid ISIL collapse (partial or total).  War is the realm of chance after all.  There are numerous indications of the effects of attrition on ISIL.  There are two possible models for this, a rapid \"wild fire\" collapse or a slow fight to the end.  Their performance to date would favor the attritional slugfest.  However, the complexity of human institutions in violent conflict leads to unpredictable outcomes.  \nAnother possibility is an ISIL decision to not contest Mosul, which could lead to an earlier far to the IA.  The precedent for this is Tal Abyad, which ISIL chose to not fight for.  Not fighting for Mosul would be a much more momentous decision, however, so I do not think this is a high probability outcome, just possible."], [13652, "2015-12-28T02:48:29Z", 0.77, "pressure mounting on obama to act"], [11785, "2015-12-28T01:40:11Z", 0.05, "Daily Beast is not the most credible source but this article lends support to my position:\n http://google.com/newsstand/s/CBIwscyY_yM "], [8229, "2015-12-28T01:29:08Z", 0.05, "Too many global powers for them to under take any offensive operations that far inside Iraq."], [14023, "2015-12-28T00:27:16Z", 0.75, "Obama will be shamed into action"], [1333, "2015-12-28T00:10:51Z", 0.17, "Lastly - and I mean it this time - WITHOUT A common enemy THE STAGE COULD BE SET FOR THE NATURAL CLEAVING OF THE NATION OF Iraq INTO ITS 3 RESPECTIVE COMPONENTS!

Daesh carefully engaged the Sunni and Baathist parties that were disenfranchised by the Maliki Gov't (which I cannot find enough descriptive phrases with which to express their level of incompetency.) What Daesh did do was unite Maliki's enemies, and used Gold before Lead to cement alliances, collecting back the gold later and eradicating competition from those who thought they would co rule with Baghdadi. The Sunni and Baathists who were attracted to IS in the 1st place have still not found satisfaction so will not be eagerly awaiting redemption but rather living in fear of of retribution.
