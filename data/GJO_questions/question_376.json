I assume the question is aimed at the \"sin\" aspect (e.g. Soda drinks are not good for you, so a tax that puts people off buying it is a \"good\" thing.) But there is clearly a grey area around this. In the UK the similar tax is being added on the sugar content, which is in addition to the standard rate of VAT that is already added to food stuffs that are not considered necessities.
