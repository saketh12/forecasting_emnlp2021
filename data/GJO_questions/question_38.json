The problem is that this event is\nfour months away.

I believe that Bush was leading at this stage in 2000 and went\non to win, but I think that his lead was larger than Trump's. \n2) I also looked at the Democrats to see what had happened - Obama won Iowa in 2008 and\nwas at 22% on October 2007.  Kerry won in 2004 and he was at 9% at this stage.  (I am simply\nusing it to see how indicative presidential polls are at this stage.)\n3) Santorum with just 3% at this stage in 2012 has gone on to win Iowa.   So in looking at the RCP polls \naverages, I'll eliminate Pataki, Graham, Santorum, Christie, Gilmore, and Kasich as they are all polling \nbelow 3%.\n4) That leaves nine - Trump, Carson, Fiorina, Cruz, Rubio, Bush, Huckabee, Jindal, and Paul.  \nAll things being equal 100 divided by 9 is an 11% chance.   Leads do mean something historically\nso Trump has a better chance than someone polling much lower.  I think there is also a chance that someone \n(Paul?) will drop out of the race by then and/or fall further in the polls.
