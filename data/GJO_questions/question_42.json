Also it wants to fight the ca. 1500 ISIS fighters who where recruited from Russian and former USSR states rather in Syria than having them return to their respective home countries for potential terror attacks. ISIS can be successfully fought only by ground forces, which Russia is not planning to sent as for now. Therefore, the Russian air force is in place in Syria for two reasons: At first it will block NATO from playing a double game, announcing to bomb ISIS, but in deed destroying Syrian's army assets, similar as it happened in Libya. Secondary, it will support the Syrian and Kurdish forces, which are the only forces fighting ISIS on the ground as for now. After meeting with Obama yesterday, who accepted the necessity to cooperate with the only real ground force in place, which is fighting ISIS - namely the regular Syrian army, it became clear that USA and Russia will coordinate their effort in the air to avoid friendly fire. Russia will use its air force only based on international law, in opposition to NATO. That means, that it will be an approval by UN SC, or a direct request by Assad, which was not publicly announced as for now. My prognosis I have adjusted to the new developments of Obama retracting from his loudly pronounced position to not to cooperate with Assad. It seems that US's policy to use yet another terror organization to seed chaos has worked only to a limited degree - it did destabilize smaller players like Libya, Syria Iraq, but the main geopolitical target Russia is well prepared and much too strong to be dealt with in this manner. China has sent its air carrier to Syria demonstrating its support for Russia. As predicted, the one who wants every thing will become nothing.
