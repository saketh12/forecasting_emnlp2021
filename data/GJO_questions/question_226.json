Meanwhile the Democrats have ramped up 8 years of massive investment in electoral data so are likely to over perform electorally relative to the popular vote. This makes a split outcome more likely if the popular vote is won by the Republicans and less likely if it is won by the Democrats.\nSince I only give Trump about 20% chance to win the popular vote, I have to adjust down from the base rate of 4% to 1%. \nRecent polling gives Clinton a 5pt lead nationally, so that makes me comfortable despite the extreme prediction.\nNormally I'd extremise to adjust for the way this prediction market works, but I don't like 100% predictions unless I believe the outcome is settled but not updated by GJO, so I wont extremise in this case.
