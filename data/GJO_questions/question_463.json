Mrs May's Florence speech was supposed to promote this idea. I do not detect any signs of this happening and its more likely that Mrs May admitting that the UK needs an interim deal, so that any new trade deal would not start until 2021, will encourage the EU to keep to the order of issues that was agreed by the 27, and is being followed by Barnier. In spite of the media saying that the current sticking point of the negotiations is the financial settlement, I see the real problem as how to deal with the Irish border. I have not heard any credible answer to how trade and migration between Northern Ireland and Eire can remain as it is now except by having have both sides inside the same free movement area and customs union. The UK has asked the EU to be creative, but has not itself provided possible answers. The UK does have a point that the Irish border question seems to be closely tied up in what trade deal ends up in place, but as far as I can see the only \"significant progress\" that could be made now would be for the UK and EU to agree that the end deal needs to include free movement and continuation of the customs union. (I am mystified why the UK agreed to the EU's order of issues, when it was obvious that it would create this difficulty.) \nThe UK could agree a financial settlement outline without there being any trade deal, but the only financial deal it could agree now would involve paying the EU a lot more than the keen Brexiteers want to pay without being able to claim it was to \"pay for trade\". May will have to face her party conference in a few days and is not likely to make any offers to the EU until after that. The only evidence that an agreement on the finance might be possible is that the most outspoken hard Brexiteers seem to be lacking in the numbers needed to tell the EU to \"go and whistle for the money\". \nThe expectation that the negotiation impasse  would be saved by Macron and Merkel's intervention looks some way off, and the German election has not brought this forward. The expectation is that Merkel will be very busy with domestic matters for at least weeks, possibly months. Even if the EU agrees to move on to trade talks presumably the UK would still not want to agree a financial settlement until there was some agreement on the trade talks.

I am not so sure that May really understands how the EU operates. Some reports today suggest May assumes that Merkel will be elected Chancellor on Sunday 24th and within days will be changing Barnier's negotiating objectives and telling all EU countries to let the UK start discussing future trade deals.  This idea could be mistaken. It is almost certain that Merkel will first be in negotiation with other parties to set up a new coalition, which depending on the outcome of the election could take some time. If Merkel then wants to change Barnier's instructions at least some show of getting all EU countries to agree new instructions would have to take place. I don't know what Mrs May can say to persuade all EU countries that \"sufficient progress\" on the  the three initial  issues has been made to move on. So far no rumours  of significant progress of any of the three issues has been reported. The UK seems to be assuming the \"outstanding liabilities\" will be settled by haggling to arrive at a figure, my take on what the EU is wanting at this stage is a list of what items that the UK accepts it is liable for, with the amounts to be calculated in due course. It is quite possible whatever Mrs May says on Friday will upset many of her own MPs, and the EU will be well aware of that.

The difficulty is that Johnson (a) implies that he would not bother with a transitional period (out of the EU but maintaining the status quo including payments) (b) would not seek a \"close\" trade deal in the long term (e.g. no Single Market, No Customs Union) but an \"arms length\"  trade  deal more similar to the EU, Japan or Canadian deals (c) would want deals with many EU institutions but would not expect to  pay anything.  This is not much different from what Mrs May said her objectives were in the Lancaster House Speech last January, but since then it has become increasingly apparent that this form of Brexit would be very damaging to the UK (businesses would need to restructure their ecosystem; currently the UK is part of a single market that has a Europe wide supply chain, if the UK is not in the Single Market and Customs Union being part of a Europe wide supply chain it is somewhere between difficult and impossible for industrial businesses, and not good for services). It is also now becoming obvious that between now and March 2019 there is not time to negotiate a bespoke trade deal (even if there is the will in the EU to do so) and not time after the outline of such a deal has been agreed, to build the infrastructure needed to operate such a trade system (goods inspection areas at ports, IT systems, recruit and train customs officers.)  \nIt had been assumed that the consensus had shifted towards a softer Brexit, and that Mrs May was likely to soften her tone in her planned speech in Florence later this week, which could have led to progress on Brexit talks. but it is now clear that the UK government it split. As far as the EU is concerned it cannot tell if any outline agreement made with the UK would survive until 2019 because no one can tell who will be running the UK government in 2019.\nJohnson's move also illustrates several aspects of his personality. Like Trump he regards facts and truth as malleable things that can be bent or stretched to fit your argument; Johnson thinks he is justified to refer to \u00a3350 million a week becoming available for the NHS or other uses, even when it is pointed out that that is not the amount that would be available to the UK. By writing the article and publishing it now, during a terrorist alert, and just before Mrs May gives a speech on the same subject, its should have been obvious to Johnson that many in government would call for him to be sacked. He must have calculated that getting sacked was risk worth taking. The way it has been described in the media, is that there only two likely outcomes, Either Boris wins and becomes PM or he losses and its the end of him. So its confirmed that Boris thinks like a gambler, place big bets and take big risks. We also know that what Boris says in his article is not a carefully considered position that he has reached after careful analysis of the facts (as he thinks facts are malleable its no surprise he takes no notice of them) but what he has concluded is a position that it is in his interest to try to sell today. It should not be forgotten that until a few months before the referendum in 2016 Johnson had not been at all sure if he would support Leave or Remain. He famously wrote two prospective newspaper columns one saying he was firmly behind Brexit, the other saying he supported staying in the EU. He chose which view to publish. Some suggested he tossed a coin, other that he calculated that saying he supported Brexit would advance his career more. No one seemed to believe any interests other than his own played any part in his decision. In fact previously his stated view was that the UK should vote to Leave the EU as a way of getting the EU to offer the UK a better deal to Remain in it (maybe he still believes that. I am sure the EU remembers his plan).  \nIt is quite possible that Boris thinks if Mrs May does sack him, he can cause trouble out of government by claiming that what ever Brexit deal May gets is worse than the deal he claims he could have got. If he is not sacked it shows that Mrs May is weak. No one seems to think Mrs May can last long as PM, so at some point in the next couple of years there will be a vacancy for leader of the Conservatives. So Johnson calculates a challenge now is in his interest. Its clearly not in the UK interest as it risks putting the Brexit negotiations back to square one.       \nhttps://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/17/boris-johnson-slapped-down-statistics-chief-fresh-350m-brexit-claim"], [6303, "2017-09-18T04:18:18Z", 0.05, "Based on general news and GJP consensus."], [14493, "2017-09-15T18:02:29Z", 0.1, "More evidence of total Brexit confusion and  new terminology; Davis now says there will be a period of \"acclimatization\"  possibly lasting as long as four years after Brexit in March 2019.

I assume that what Davis says is supposed to be interpreted by the listener so that they hear what they want to hear. Saying the Outstanding Liabilities had reduced to \u00a360 billion only sounds impressive to someone who thought the bill would be 100 billion Euros, but if it has been leaked that the UK would be OK with paying \u00a350 billion is sounds as if a deal can be reached, but \u00a350 billion is quite a lot higher than the nothing that Boris had suggested was appropriate.  Many people will be pleased to hear that progress has been made on immigration, but some Brexit voters might wonder what the progress entails if in the same sentence it is reported that the government had no desire to handicap business.

If Mrs May continues to dither or sticks to the idea that a bespoke EU deal can be agreed with the EU, ratified by all and implemented by March 2019 I cannot see any agreement on the outstanding payments happening this year (or ever).\nEvidence for the dithering: Hammond last week was telling business that he wanted an interim period after March 2019 that maintained the \"status quo\". This implied the same relationship between the UK and EU regarding the Single Market, Customs Union, continued paying into the EU budget, continuing Freedom of Movement, continued relationship to the ECJ. Now the message has changed to \"close to the status quo\", \"a similar relationship to the Single Market, a similar but different Customs Union\", maybe, maybe not payments to the EU, maybe, maybe not some kind of sort of free-ish movement of people, but with controls.\nThe UK government is continuing to blame \"foreign\" organizations for forcing the UK to follow stupid rules, when in fact the fault is that the UK has boxed itself into problems. An example this week has been Mrs May and others blaming the OECD and saying the OECD will not let the UK spend money of hurricane relief in the Caribbean because the countries the UK wants to help are too rich. This seems to me to be exactly the sort of misleading nonsense that encouraged Brexit.  I don't believe there is any OECD rule that is stopping the UK spending money on Hurricane relief, what the rule is, is that spending money in relatively better of countries for Hurricane relief is not defined by the OECD as \"official development assistance to developing countries\". The fact that the UK wants to use money from its OECD Development aid budget to a disaster relieve budget is a problem that has been created wholly by the UK. Hardly any OECD countries comes anywhere near the recommended 0.7% of GDP fort \"development assistance\", the fact that the UK has put the 0.7% into a law is what is stopping the UK using some of the 0.7% for Hurricane relief, not the OECD. \nThis might seem a trivial matter, but it is symptomatic of the way that \"foreign interference\" in the UK has been used by UK politicians and parts of the media to push a populist agenda.  First the UK works with an international body to get an international agreement about something that is laudable. Then the UK implements an interpretation of that agreement that is very literal and allows no flexibility. Then the UK finds it is in breach of the agreement that it was instrumental in setting up. Then the Daily Mail and Daily Telegraph (both papers owned by UK tax exiles) berate the \"international organizations\" for daring to tell the UK what to do, and demand that the international organizations change the rules or the UK will quit whatever international organization it is.  The game is called \"blame someone else, preferably someone foreign\". \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-41274743\nhttp://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4881734/Britain-BANNED-using-13billion-aid-budget.html"], [38, "2017-09-13T19:21:53Z", 0.0, "I'm wondering what GJO Admins will consider an \"agreement\".

The psychology is very interesting. I am not a psychologist so I am wading in dangerous waters, but I can see a man who is constantly putting up obstacles to block his own progress. For example yesterday he presented a bill to parliament (The EU withdrawal bill) that was described in the parliamentary debate as an \"astonishing monstrosity\" and was heavily criticized not only by opposition MPs, but by both Pro and Anti Brexit MPs as giving a \"blank cheque\" to ministers. It appears Davis had ignored suggestions to publish a draft, which had he done so, the complained about clauses could have been amended before it got to Parliament.  Davis then decided that those pointing out what was wrong with the bill were trying stop Brexit. \nBarnier has accused Davis as going backward in the Brexit negotiations, by changing his mind on things that he had previously accepted such as that the UK would settle what it owned and that he accepted Barnier's sequence of topics (no trade talks, until the first three items had made progress) - now Davis seems to expect to move to trade talks without progressing on other matters.\nIt is difficult to see how the Brexit negotiations are helped by Davis saying that he has ruled out membership of the EEA and EFTA even as an interim, when the UK government is apparently asking for a transitional agreement that gives the UK the same relationship with the EU Single Market and Customs Union as it does now. Ignoring the question of how the EU may feel about it, it is obvious that given that 15 months have passed since the referendum with no visible progress on any Brexit deal it is unrealistic to expect to be able to negotiate, not only the Brexit leaving arrangements, but a totally new legal construction for an interim EU/UK Single Market and Customs Union and get that agreed by all 27 countries in the next 18 months. Rejecting the off the shelf options of the EEA and EFTA, Davis appears to be planing to fail to have any deal agreed by March 2019. \nWe then need to ask why he wants to slow down negotiations by creating objections to what appear to be possible solutions. I assume that it is because he knows that a deal that lives up to what he told voters in the referendum is not possible. Failure to achieve the deal he said would be easy has to be blamed on someone, so he is busy getting the blame in now; its the EU, its Remoaners sabotaging, its Parliament blocking him. \nIts a popular tactic by Populists; Maduro says Venezuela's  problems are caused by foreigners and businesses and nothing to do with his policies, Trump's failures to do things (Mexican Wall, improve healthcare system, stop NK) are because other people blocked him, not because he actually had no idea how to achieve what he had promised. \nTelling voters you can do things they like is easy, doing them is not so easy especially it involves getting other parties to agree to things they do not like. \nMy guess is that sometime between now and March 2019 Davis will quit (assuming he is not fired) claiming he has been sabotaged, because the last thing that Davis wants is to carry the can for failing to get the Brexit agreement he promised.

The UK just saying it does not like the EU proposal is not likely to lead to a resolution.

A three year implementation period, where everything stayed the same, except that the UK was technically out of the EU (out of the Commission, out of the Council of Ministers, out of the Parliament, but in the Single Market, in the Customers Union, still under the ECJ, still subject to the 4 freedoms, still paying its subs), would be convenient for Davis because most of the outstanding liabilities are commitments that the UK entered into are for the EU Budget pertiod 2014 to 2020.

If that really was its prime objective it would have got on with presenting credible ideas to resolve the first 3 items on the Brexit agenda, the fact that it has spent 5 months since A50 was invoked and 14 months since the referendum and has not got anywhere close to agreeing anything suggests either great incompetence or a lack of will. In either case it seems unlikely that the UK will change tack.

I may be confused but the Telegraph story does not seem to involve the UK answering the question that the EU is asking.

Some sources have the story as the \u00a336 billion including \u00a310 billion a year during a 3 year \"implementation\" period after the UK has officially left the EU, during this period if the UK is getting the benefits of the EU it would be expected that it would need to keep paying at the current rate.

Today's issue concerns Euratom (the European Atomic Energy Community) which is a separate organisation from the EU, it is not under the control of the European Parliament, but is under the European Court of Justice. The UK gave notice in March that it was leaving Euratom when it leaves the EU, but a cross party group of MPs have pointed out that leaving Euratom will create problems in maintaining supplies of nuclear material of all types (including medical isotopes) and it appears that this cross party group has enough Conservative supporters to cause problems for Mrs May.\nThis argument provides a test of what Brexit actually means. The referendum asked if the UK should leave the EU, it did not ask if the UK should leave Euratom nor did it specifically ask if the UK should leave the jurisdiction of the ECJ. It is Mrs May who has interpreted the referendum to mean that the UK has to leave the jurisdiction of the ECJ, and it is Mrs May (possibly with legal advice from the EU) who has concluded that therefore the UK has to leave Euratom. \nThe ECJ seems to be hinge on which Brexit is swinging. All the European agreements that Mrs May wants to retain links to come under the jurisdiction of  the ECJ. To retain the links without the ECJ would seem to require that all the members of these organisations agree to the jurisdiction of a new (so far undefined) court. There seems to be no obvious advantage to any of the other 28 members of Euratom (or any of the other organisations) in charging the court and its difficult to see why they would all agree. It is far from obvious what advantage the UK would get either. It seems to be an example of where the Leave campaign has shot themselves in the foot. By claiming that its necessary to leave the jurisdiction  of the ECJ  in order to \"take back control\", it has made it impossible to have any relationship with not only the EU, but with other European organisations, without the whole of Europe agreeing to change to fit what the UK wants. There is no sign of that happening.  So either the UK must back down (which seems most likely) or its over the cliff edge. \nA very similar argument about the role of the ECJ will stop any agreement about protection of EU citizens in the UK. \nMrs May created three tests of leaving the EU. Leaving the jurisdiction of the ECJ was one. It appears that this will not be possible. That leaves two remaining tests. One concerned payments to the EU, which seems now to have been accepted will continue if the UK gets a trade deal with the EU, Which just leaves the issue of Freedom of Movement. So we seem to be back to where we were in early 2016. \nI would suggest that the Leavers picked the wrong EU institution it should have said it no longer wanted the European Parliament or European Commission not blame the ECJ for what they did not like about the EU.

In other words they think the UK places emotions over money, but the EU puts money ahead of emotions. They then claim its the EU that is not rational! \n It is thought that leaving the EU with no deal (on WTO terms) would not get parliamentary approval. So if \"no deal\" is out and \"a bespoke trade deal by March 2019\" is out, that seems to only leave a few options (a) staying in the EU (b) leaving the EU but stay in the EEA either as a permanent or a transitional arrangement.

Presumably she is doing it for the reason I suggested; so that she can blame parliament as a whole when it all goes wrong and claim it was not her fault. \nWhile there are still hardline Brexiteers claiming that the EU will cave in and negotiate a trade deal before March 2019, the general consensus among commentators is now that (a) the EU is not interested in giving the UK a deal  \"as good as being in the EU\" and (b) even if was minded to, it would take too long to negotiate a bespoke deal before the cut off date.\nThe Brexiteers hold the view that while UK voters are prepared to be a lot poorer in order to enjoy the advantages on not being in the EU, the EU would be prepared to put the future of the EU in doubt in order to avoid a small reduction in the EU's trade. In other words they think the UK places emotions over money, but the EU puts money ahead of emotions. They then claim its the EU that is not rational! \n It is thought that leaving the EU with no deal (on WTO terms) would not get parliamentary approval. So if \"no deal\" is out and \"a bespoke trade deal by March 2019\" is out, that seems to only leave a few options (a) staying in the EU (b) leaving the EU but stay in the EEA either as a permanent or a transitional arrangement.  In neither of these cases would an agreement on paying the UK's outstanding liabilities apply. \nI am not going for an answer of \"0\" because Mrs May could be gone before the end of the year.

But like most things the May government does they don't seem to have thought it through, because in September Germany will be in election mode and Germany. France and EU wil be just as keen as the UK is to show how tough they can be. \nMrs May is rapidly losing political control of the UK. There are daily briefing by off-message ministers contradicting each other and the official government position on whatever policy is unpopular on the day. Mrs May is now being called \"Mrs U Turn\". Mrs May needs to change direction to regain control. I have a couple of suggestions for her:-\n(a) make all votes connected with Brexit free votes. Mrs May's version of Brexit is increasingly being challenged, so rather than lurch from stubborn refusal to change her mind, to U turn, to stubborn to change her mind again, to another U turn, why not say that Brexit is a non-party political issue, it was decided by the public in a referendum so its up to the whole of parliament to interpret what Brexit means (i.e. not just her) and to implement it. That way she avoids having to make U turns and if parliament messes up, is to \"hard\" or too \"soft\" the public can blame their local MP not the PM.\n(b) address the \"people\" as a grown up. Explain that continuing austerity is a direct consequence of Brexit. Those who voted \"Leave\" have to accept that it was explained that Brexit would cost them. (I have spoken to many \"Leave\" voters who told me they would not mind being a bit poorer as long as they got back control.) Obviously as the UK has not left the EU yet, the full cost of Brexit to them is not yet known. The lower pound and higher inflation are just the foothills of the mountains the UK has to climb. There is an imbalance between the austerity suffered by different sectors of society that will need to be rectified. Therefore she should propose a reversal; that younger public sector workers will get pay rises equal to 1% less than the rate of inflation, and pension increases will be caped at 1% a year. She should say that this will be tough for everyone, but that country should remember the dark days of World War II, and how everyone suffered for freedom and that no one moaned last time rationing was required.

The probabilities of the various outcomes for Brexit have certainly changed in the last week. Prior to the UK General Election it was considered anti-democratic to question Mrs May's interpretation that the public was demanding a Brexit that would mean the UK no longer allowing the Free Movement of People (within the EU), would not accept the rulings of the EU Court of Justice, and would not pay substantial sums into the EU. Many, if not most people, who had any knowledge of what these things were, considered that if the UK rules these things out there was zero chance of any substantive trade deal with the EU. Mrs May has ruled out the UK remaining in the EU Customs Union, which most people believe would be a necessity for a \"friction less trade deal\". Membership of the Customs Unions would also (appear) be required to keep an open border between the two parts of Ireland. Thus the UK's Brexit aims appeared to be contradictory (as in \"having your cake and eating it\"). \nThe election campaign and the result suggest that fewer UK voters than it was thought believe that Mrs May is capable of delivering the Brexit that she has outlined. It is also clear that many voters did not actually want the \"hard Brexit\" that Mrs May had promised to deliver, as they had voted for for parties or candidates that made it clear that they did not believe that Brexit meant no Customs Union, no ECJ, and maybe not even no Free movement of People. Mrs May will need to rely on at least one of these parties (the DUP) and one faction (the Scottish Conservatives) in order to remain PM (plus other non-believers in Hard Brexit in the English Conservative Party). So it not clear how she can cling to \"hard Brexit\".\nThe two previous Conservative PMs (as well as the two previous Labour PMs) have now all made public their views that Mrs May should not be the sole arbiter of what Brexit means. \nSo logically Mrs May will be forced to take notice of those who while accepting that the referendum said the UK should leave the EU, did not say what the UK's relationship with the EU should be. \nTherefore it appears that the UK could move toward a compromise and that an agreement with the EU could be easier. \nBut there still exists a block of true believers in a hard Brexit and until that block admits that a hard Brexit would be an economic and social disaster, will continue to claim that the only reason that the UK is being denied \"having its cake and eating it\" is that Brexit is being sabotaged by liberals globalists. Therefore the UK Government might still continue with the delusion that it is possible to reach an agreement with the EU that will give the hard core Brexiteers what they say UK voters want (but the election has shown may not be what they want). As the UK economy continues to deteriorate (compared to the US, EU and OECD) and no progress is made in made with Brexit negotiations, it would not be unreasonable to guess that most UK voters will get fed up with Mrs May's \"weak and wobbly\" leadership and demand an end to the Brexit uncertainty. A further test for Mrs May will the converting of  EU legislation into UK legislation. I am expecting that this will prove far more complex than has so far been recognized. My guess is that at some point voters will be happy to settle for the UK leaving the EU, but remaining in the Customs Union and EEA.\nThis would require almost no contentious deals with the EU, as Freedom of Movement would still exist (albeit with temporary opt outs for some zones of the UK as permitted under the rules), the ECJ would be replaced by the EFTA Court (they both use the same laws just have different judges), and EEA members are required to pay into the EEA/EU (so not much to argue about there). \nTherefore the softest option (a) cancel A50 and remain in the EU (as suggested by Macron) and the soft option (b) leaving the EU but not the EEA  would appear easy to achieve. I think one or other of these option is quite likely, what is in doubt is at what point the UK gets fed up with trying to get the unobtainable. My guess is that Mrs May will want to continue to move as slowly as possible, using the excuse that Germany is having elections in the autumn (had no one told her before she triggered A50?) \nI am not sure why Mrs May wants to go through the charade that she is going to get the hard Brexit deal she says the UK wants. I assume she is still under the delusion that UK voters think they need her to deliver what cannot be delivered. The election should have taught her that the UK voters are not as stupid as she thinks they are and very few actually believe she can deliver. (They have noticed her track record on on delivering what she says are her aims is not very good; after 7 years she (fortunately for the economy) got nowhere on reducing the net migration numbers, and has not stopped terrorist attacks, reduced the poverty gap and will probably now be blamed for the tower block fire in London). \nGetting back to the detail of the question- it remains likely that no deal on the UK EU liabilities will be struck this year. Either because the EU and UK cannot agree the figures (or even ab outline), because the UK refuses to follow the EU's sequence of what to negotiate (and therefore the EU does what it has threatened to do, spend another year producing a terms of reference for its trade negotiators.) Or the UK will have cancelled A50 or have opted for remaining in the EEA and therefore it is arguable that there is no need to calculate outstanding liabilities as it will continue making payments). \n "], [38, "2017-06-13T18:37:38Z", 0.33, "I'm thinking that my current forecast (14%) is too strong given the increasing uncertainty in EU countries:\n-the outcome of the election in the UK, and the recent significant weakening of May.

In other words the UK does not want to agree a framework for leaving before it has agreed a framework for its future relationship. It is viewing the negations as all being part of one transaction.  Clearly there is a difference of opinion between the EU and UK, but I don't see how the EU can insist of the UK agreeing to the EU order of events unless the matter is decided in the EU's favour by the ECJ. I am not a lawyer but A50 does not seem to clearly support the idea that the leaving framework has to be agreed before starting the future relationship discussions. \nUnless someone has got a secret plan that will please everyone in the EU, and the UK, and is completely uncontroversial it seems unlikely that much will be decided before the next German Government is in place. It has been suggested that going by previous German elections and negotiation about forming coalitions, the next German Government will not be in place until November of December 2017.
