For President Trump, his reluctance thus far has shown his desire to not break any ties with Saudi Arabia. Pressure is also on congress to psuh for these sanctions, but there is no way in telling if they are willing to push the president in this direction. Talk about sanctioning Saudi Arabia is focused on the Global Magnitsky Act, legislation that authorizes sanctions targeting individuals responsible for gross human rights abuses. That is because the Trump administration has shown little desire to hold autocrats to account, while Congress has a role in Magnitsky sanctions.
