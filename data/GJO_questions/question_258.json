So things don't look promising for him. DWS has also been somewhat savvy in scheduling the only debate for a Sunday morning, reducing Canova's ability to spread his message and attract voters. Canova will have to rely on word-of-mouth and advertising, which the DNC scandal may suggest that DWS is quite good at overcoming. Canova has also gathered the vast majority of his fundraising from out-of-state, meaning he is not earning the necessary local support and votes. The biggest supporters of Canova would most likely be the same supporters of Bernie Sanders - young, white millennials - which tend to have lower voter turn outs. Hillary Clinton handily won the primaries by nearly 40 points suggesting little help will be available from the supporters Canova needs.
