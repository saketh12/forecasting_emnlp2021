So for all we know they could already be building a case against Hillary and prepping a grand jury for the trial. \nMy personal theory was that the timing of this is not coincidental. The e-mail controversy became public in March 2015 and there was ample time to bring up charges before she managed to: \n1. delete >90% of the all the emails that contained classified information and provide only personal 'innocent' emails.\n2. blame her assistants that they were the ones who didn't handle the servers and the communications properly.\n3. cherry-pick and provide the authorities only the emails she wanted them to see (c. 5-6%)\nSo they delayed this event as much as they could in order to reach the 'immune' status she currently enjoys because of wallstreet investment banks lobby and other organizations: https://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/contrib.php?cid=N00000019&cycle=Career\nIn this way she would clear all charges against her in a way only possible through this particular circumstances. If she didn't enjoy her current status I believe situation would be much different.\nAlso these sort of proceedings are largely decided by Loretta Lynch ( Bill's old friend, whom she owes).\nThis hurts her chances for the presidential election but she still escapes unscarred a situation that would translate to 10 - 15 years of prison time under different circumstances.

The question asks whether Hillary Clinton will be indicted. There are multiple ways to get a defendant in front of a judge, but the question narrows those options to one: the indictment.  Neither a deal between Clinton and the government in lieu of an indictment nor the DOJ charging Clinton with a non-indictable offense will resolve the question.  Obviously, Clinton will not be indicted if the FBI investigation fails to uncover evidence of a crime.\n\nAssuming the FBI does recommend an indictable offense, keep in mind that an indictment comes from a grand jury and *only* a grand jury.  The DOJ may accept the FBI\u2019s recommendation but that still does not mean Clinton has been indicted.  The DOJ must take the additional steps of empaneling a grand jury and presenting the evidence of her alleged crimes to them.  The grand jury would then vote to \u201ctrue bill\u201d (indict) or \u201cno bill\u201d (not indict) on each of the potential crimes presented.  Usually, a grand jury does what the DOJ wants, but that is more of a factor that grand jury proceedings are one-sided and the DOJ determines what to present rather than the grand jury simply rubber stamping the indictment.  One fact we do not know is whether a grand jury has already been empaneled.  If they are already hearing testimony and reviewing evidence, then the process would be further along. Some of the right-leaning media outlets seem to believe one has been empaneled.  I have not found anything concrete to support their claim but the DOJ will not comment or acknowledge ongoing grand jury proceedings."], [1019, "2016-07-04T11:10:14Z", 0.0, "Intent is the key word for indictment"], [20364, "2016-07-04T06:03:36Z", 0.05, "IF it hasn't happened by now, it ain't going to happen.

Partisan score 25%: Republican may have the motivation to prosecute a high profile democrat especially a presidential candidate. The republicans would have higher motivation to do so had they have a strong candidate of their preference. 3. Ability 15%: If DOJ would declined to prosecute former Utah attorney general John Swallow for corruptions with mounting evidence after \"thorough investigation\"; after the State decided to prosecute, the DOJ's U.S Attorney to Utah David Barlow(who used to be attorney for Utah senator Michael Lee) simply resigned. One would expect Clitons' have far more clout than Hatch-links. Had Bush stayed in the game, the ability portion would ranked higher as it may be a game between old money vs. new money.
