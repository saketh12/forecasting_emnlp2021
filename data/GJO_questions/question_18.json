There seems almost no chance that any of the current area trade deals involving the USA or the EU will be ratified anytime soon because in the public mind negotiated trade deals equate to giving jobs to foreigners and/or setting up arbitration systems that give away sovereignty. So the average voter is convinced that a trade deal is a \"bad thing\". (What the average voter wants is a gun boat sent to the foreign country to force them to give us a sweet deal, as we did things in the 19th Century).   \nHowever the question is will negotiations  be completed. Negotiations could be completed with an agreement that is likely to be ratified, Negotiations could be completed with an agreement that is unlikely to be ratified. Negotiations could be completed with no agreement at all.  With several big elections coming up in the next 15 months or so (US, French, German etc.) it is unknown which politicians would be in office when any TTIP agreement came up for ratification. Therefore completing negotiations in 2016 seems pointless because that would mean attempting to ratify an agreement that had been made under a different administration (certainly in the US and almost certainly in France). So it seems to me that it would be more productive to get as far with a TTIP agreement as possible this year, but leave the really difficult area for the next administration to struggle with. TTIP will be difficult sell, a TTIP agreement made by a previous administration, that started discussions when free trade sounded a \"good thing\", will be impossible to sell now that its viewed as a \"bad thing\".

As regards France, its influence in EU decision making has been declining in recent years and the remarks of the French State Secretary for Foreign Trade are to be weighed in the context of the next French regional elections in December 2015. The French government and socialist party are really down in the polls and have to redeem themselves in the eye of the French public opinion.

Reaching an agreement on the TTIP would indeed prevent the UK to leave the EU and would probably be one of the best arguments against euro-skeptics in the UK. It would consequently help prevent a EU explosion.
