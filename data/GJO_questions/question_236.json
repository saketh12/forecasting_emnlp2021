On 16 October 2016, the Scottish Government published a draft bill that would enable a second Scottish independence referendum to occur, after receiving legislative consent. The Scottish Independence Referendum Bill draft is largely similar to its sister act of 2013, and has been put out for consultation by the government to allow the public to convey their views on the wording and procedures of the bill.\n2.  As the constitution is a 'reserved' matter under the Scotland Act 1998, for a future referendum on Scottish independence to be binding under UK law, it would need to receive the consent of the British Parliament to take place.\n3.  The Scotland Act 1998 empowers the Scottish Parliament to legislate in policy areas devolved to Scotland, but one of its clauses obliges the Scottish Parliament to ensure its legislation is compatible with European law. For the UK to completely leave the EU, it would need to remove that obligation. If the UK Parliament wishes to legislate on policy areas devolved to Scotland, or if it wishes to amend the powers devolved to Scotland, by convention it needs the Scottish Parliament to pass a \"legislative consent motion\".\n4.  Media reports suggested this might give the Scottish Parliament a veto over UK withdrawal from the EU, but under the Scotland Act 1998 the UK Parliament could ultimately override the \"veto\" as it is based only on parliamentary convention.\n____________________________________\nCOMMENT:  There are so many issues to iron out before a referendum can take place.

An Independence referendum is a UK Constitutional matter. Constitutional matters have not been devolved to the Scottish Parliament (\"Scotland\") but are reserved by the UK Parliament in Westminster. Therefore before Scotland could set a date for a referendum the Westminster Parliament would have to pass legislation authorising  it. There seems to be no appetite by the UK government to authorise another referendum. \nTherefore in order for anyone to set a date for another referendum would require (a) The Scottish Parliament to decide that there was a very high probability of winning a 2nd independence referendum (b) the Scottish government demanding that events had meant that the results of the first referendum should be ignored and request that Westminster authorise a 2nd referendum  (c) something to happen to change the UK government's mind. \nAlthough the UK has voted for Brexit, which could be considered grounds for holding a 2nd referendum, as yet it is totally unclear what form Brexit will be (or indeed if it will actually happen). Until it is clear what form  Brexit will take it will remain equally unclear what impact, if any, it would have on Scotland there are not really any grounds for holding a 2nd Scottish referendum.\nCoupled with this the problems that are arising from having a Brexit referendum that only established what the voters did not want (they did not want to be in the EU) but did not actually establish what relationship, if any, voters wanted the UK to have with the EU. It can now be seen that there is a very high probability that having voted for Brexit, whatever relationship between the UK and EU results, a majority of voters will be unhappy with the outcome (e.g. if 48% did not want to leave, 10% want no deal with the EU at all, 10% want to be in the EEA, and 32% want some other arrangement then it will not be possible to give the majority what they want). The 1st Scottish referendum was a vague as the UK EU referendum, now with the benefit of the Brexit vote it is likely that Scottish Independence voters would want to vote for something more concrete than just leaving the UK, they would expect to be voting for a specific relationship with both the UK and EU.    \nIt is probable that by July 2017 it will still be unclear what the relationship between the UK and EU will be. \n "], [27879, "2016-07-28T15:28:12Z", 0.22, "Theresa May would delay invoking article 50 for as long as possible within the legal time frame.\nAlthough the Scottish would most probably call for another referendum, they would not do that until its official. \nThe SNP needs to meet numerous requirements to fulfill before that day, which would definitely slow down the process.
