We move the ball a little bit further down the field every year, but we need to hit the goal and be done with this,\u201d . . ..Going into the General Assembly\u2019s 60-day session, these local groups are once again lobbying to see the constitutional amendment ratified in both the Senate and House of Delegates.\n\n. . . . [the Weber's] traveled to New York City for . . .  [Eastan's] milestone 10th birthday last June, and while there, they made plans to take a picture of her standing next to the Fearless Girl statue that was still installed on Wall Street. The 4-foot bronze statue of a little girl . . . stood opposite the iconic Charging Bull sculpture and represented the need for gender equality. \u201cI loved it [the photo] because she was my kid, but neither one of us were prepared for how other people reacted to it. It is almost like she became this little living mascot for women\u2019s rights or girl\u2019s rights or just fairness in women\u2019s futures because that was the basis of that statute,\u201d .\n\n\u201cI was horrified to find out that it is OK to pay me less than a boy even though I work as hard as him, am as smart as him and am better for the job,\u201d Eastan said. \u201cAt first when my mom told me the ERA wasn\u2019t passed in Virginia but it was in other states I was confused because I thought we had equal rights already, and then in comes pow, in your face that we don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nWhen the Women-Matter group asked to use Eastan\u2019s photo for this purpose, the Webers agreed. Weber said they received permission from the statue\u2019s artist to use the image in marketing materials but not State Street Corporation, which commissioned it, so it was removed from their marketing materials and what was left was her daughter standing proud.\n\nThe advocacy of a new generation, \u201cyou could feel it in that photograph,\u201d . . . . She saw the photo as showing that the message of the need for the ERA had reached a new generation and that \u201ctheir advocacy is the blood transfusion we needed.\u201d\n\nThe image is on an electronic billboard near where I-95 and I-64 meet so it could greet legislators in the General Assembly as they arrived in Richmond for the new session this month, she said.\n\nAll of the attention has surprised Eastan, who struggled to wrap her head around why her picture would be such a prominent part of the fight for women\u2019s equality, her mom said.\n\n\u201cShe really feels there are all of these older ladies who have been working on this issue for so many years. Why is she getting this attention?\u201d Weber said. \u201cI said part of what her contribution is is she has a genuine and authentic belief in this subject.\u201d\n\nOn the same billboard that displays Eastan\u2019s image is a slogan made special by Ani Hornung, a 12-year-old homeschooled Powhatan student and the daughter of Kati and Andrew Hornung.\n\nThe simple phrase \u201cNot One More GenERAtion\u201d highlights the need for the Equal Rights Amendment to be passed so another generation of girls doesn\u2019t have to experience the same kind of discrimination as those who came before, said Kati Hornung. Hornung learned that the ERA had not been ratified in Virginia several years ago but didn\u2019t really start getting involved until last year.\n\n. . . \u201cI was upset; I think it should have passed awhile ago,\u201d Ani said. \u201cI want to see the ERA passed very, very badly.\u201d So they made some homemade signs, and on one where her mom had written \u201cNot one more generation,\u201d Ani noticed ERA was in the word generation and colored them red and underlined them.\n\nDavis was at that rally in front of the General Assembly and remembers seeing Ani\u2019s homemade sign and her emphasis on the ERA in generation. \u201cI looked at that sign and I said \u2018My God it has been staring at us in the face all the time,\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cThe reflection of the new generation is looking at it and saying how long has this been going on? My generation is going to take care of it. She has just caught it. It came from a 12-year-old Powhatan kid, a phrase that is taking off nationally.\u201d\n\nThe involvement of the girls and young women is a good sign of more people learning about the Equal Rights Amendment simply because many people erroneously believe it already passed, Davis said. She said that far too many women don\u2019t even know this is still an issue others are fighting for on their behalf.\n\nProponents of the amendment also face arguments that the ERA is not needed anymore because the rights of women are already protected under laws such as the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, Equal Pay Act and Violence Against Women Act.\n Women\u2019s groups such as Women-Matter argue those are all laws that can be altered or repealed and have no constitutional standing. Davis cites the words of the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, who was interviewed by California Lawyer in a January 2011 issue and said, \"Certainly the Constitution does not require discrimination on the basis of sex. The only issue is whether it prohibits it. It doesn't.\"\n\n. . . \u201cI think there is a lot of misinformation about this issue. I also think when you are used to privilege, equality feels like oppression. I feel there are a lot of people who feel that to give equality to everyone, those who enjoy privilege have to give something up,\u201d. . .  Equality is like love; the more you give the more you have.\u201d"], [46458, "2018-01-19T08:43:16Z", 0.0, "The states so inclined, already have.
