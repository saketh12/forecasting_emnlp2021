He is perhaps the only non-family member who knows the inner workings of the Trump Organization. Michael Cohen will be a key figure in understanding Trump\u2019s recent business relationships with several overseas partners suspected of potentially engaging in money laundering, corruption, and sanctions violations. (A federal criminal investigation of Cohen includes more than four million business files that will soon be turned over to investigators and are likely to shed light on the company\u2019s operations during the ten years that Cohen was involved.) But it is only Weisselberg who can recount the essence of the Trump Organization from the beginning of Donald Trump\u2019s involvement: in the nineteen-seventies, when the company first discriminated against African-Americans; in the eighties, when Trump appears to have been in business with the New York mafia; in the nineties, when Trump\u2019s casino was in violation of anti-money-laundering laws; and through the aughts, as Trump developed ties to many Russian and former-Soviet oligarchs and political figures.\nThe Trump Foundation case may have already revealed a potential rift between Weisselberg and the family. His deposition in the case is fascinating reading. Weisselberg makes it quite clear just how sloppy an operation the foundation was, with no meetings and no careful accounting. In a compelling exchange, Weisselberg describes how he flew to Iowa with a checkbook to give money to political allies of Trump, then a Presidential candidate, and he makes it clear that he did this because his boss told him to. It is a damning statement, and the first evidence I have seen that Weisselberg, when cornered, may be willing to shift blame to the President. Judge Scarpulla will continue pushing the Trumps to settle. Trump-watchers, though, will likely hope that the family chooses to fight. We will learn much more if Weisselberg and others take the stand.\""], [12573, "2018-07-08T21:51:28Z", 0.16, "It depends upon whether both houses of Congress are under Republican control.

So I think he's gun shy.  Instead, he's trying to erode the credibility of the DOJ and the focus of his ire appears to have moved from Mueller to Rosenstein.  Firing Mueller would make him look guilty and Trump is all about the optics and the optics wouldn't be good.  But if he can fire Rosenstein and fill the slot with a psychophant, he could control the investigation without firing Mueller.  From Trump's perspective that would be better than firing Mueller.  And that appears to be where Trump is going.  Now if  Trump pulls that off, will Mueller resign? I don't think so. Mueller is an ex-Marine, giving up isn't his style.  Ultimately, I don't think firing either Rosenstein or Mueller is tactically a good move for Trump.  But Trump has a habit of making bad moves.  Finally, there are the fall elections, I don't think Trump wants voters to be thinking about the Trump-Russia investigation in the final months before the election. He'd much rather have them thinking about Hillary. Firing either Rosenstein or Mueller would bring intense attention and further energize the Democratic base.  Republicans don't want an energized Democratic base.  They don't want Democrats voting, because when Democrats vote, Republicans lose.  The fall elections will be tough on Republicans, I don't think Trump wants to make it tougher.  The last thing Trump wants is a Democratic Congress.  So what happens after the election?  If Democrats win Congress, firing Mueller would make impeachment inevitable.  If Republicans hold Congress, Trump may well fire Rosenstein and or Mueller because impeachment would be an impossibility.  Republicans will never impeach Trump even if he shot people on 5th Avenue.  Now, what happens if Mueller indicts Trump and/or his family or reports evidence of collusion to Congress before the election? I think all hell breaks out.  Trump may very well fire both Rosenstein and Mueller at that point because Trump is a very emotional fellow and unable to restrain himself. Trump has never been good at self-discipline. At that point, Democrats get elected and Trump is impeached.  And given Mueller has postponed Flynn's sentencing till September, I think there is a window in August and September where this is a very real possibility.  Between October 1 and the fall election, I doubt Mueller will make any legal filings or reports in order to avoid the possibility of unfairly influencing the election.
