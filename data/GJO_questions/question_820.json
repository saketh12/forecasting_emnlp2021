I had not heard anyone campaigning with any message that the EU was linked to any issue about the war (which war? WW2?) or the blueberries. So I dismissed the woman's reasons. But now I have seen the samples of  ads that were run on Facebook by Vote Leave I can see how her reasons might make sense (to her).\nI had, arrogantly thought that seeing a few more adverts saying Vote for Brexit using the same arguments that I had seen were unlikely to have made much difference to the vote. But these targeted Facebook adverts are nothing like the mainstream adverts. They have pictures of cups of tea, polar bears, bull fight etc. with the suggestion that the EU is tying to stop Brits drinking tea and is blocking the UK from helping to save polar bears and encouraging bull fights. It seems there were 1433 different targeted adverts. Obviously I have not seen them all, but it seems very possible that some of them could have shown an old person or a picture of the Battle of Britain and suggesting that remaining in the EU was letting the fighters down, it seems quite possible that another of the 1433 was promoting the idea that somehow blueberries would be cheaper after Brexit. \nThe fact that the Leave voter quoted the reasons she did, strongly suggests she had seen an advert telling her to vote that way. The reasons that were passed on to me as to why other Leave voters voted how they did also often seemed odd, but I had assumed the voters were just misunderstanding the arguments, not being fed pure fantasy. I know that at least some (older) voters who were getting all their news via social media  So I have changed my mind and now think these adverts could very well have changed the outcome of the vote.   \nAs it seems that the source of money that paid for the adverts is questionable it does look as if the result is compromised (Ignoring the over spending) an investigation similar to the USA Mueller Investigation is needed.

Many like to follow the example of Brexit, however, it should be noted that the United Kingdom was in a unique position within the European Union. The UK was granted many opt outs in areas such as the Eurozone, Schengen, and the charter of fundamental rights. Therefore, the UK was not well integrated within the EU paradigm which made its exit relatively easy, and was boosted by its large economy. Nearly all other Euroskeptic countries are part of both the Eurozone and Schengen, and their exit would create massive disruptions for their societies. The Pew Research Center has also conducted a major study and has found that nearly a year after the Brexit vote, the view of the EU has become more positive and there is not widespread appetite for leaving the Union. However, Pew research notes that there is a slight increase in citizens who want a referendum on membership. However, it is still not a considerable majority and the governments face no pressure to implement a referendum, especially more Euroskeptic countries in the V4, who still rely on EU funds for their economy. However, there is still a concern over Greece, as the Greek economy has still not properly recovered from the Eurozone crisis. The Euro is also a culprit in holding back Greece, as they cannot rely on their own national currency, the drachma, to drop in value and make their exports more competitive and help alleviate some of the economic issues. The Greek people also despise the austerity measures imposed upon them by the IMF and the EU, and have elected a new government in 2015 in the hopes of ending the measures, but to little avail. If the issue is not resolved soon, there could be a desperate push for a referendum, but there is still a debate of whether the benefits outweigh the costs.

However, the continued rise of populism in Europe and some recent developments in Brexit negotiations render it possible. The world has seen many European populist movements arise and gain popularity in Europe over the past few years. Most recently in early March Italian elections, a majority of votes went to the Five Star Movement, which is willing to work alongside other far right parties against the euro and immigration in Italy. Further, in Brexit negotiations a new agreement has been reached regarding the transition period in which the UK will officially leave the EU and the two parties will begin negotiating trade and future relations. As long as populist movements continue to rise in European countries and the UK provides a successful model for leaving the EU, it is possible that another country will schedule a referendum to leave. However given the short time frame I feel that it is very unlikely in the near future, although in the long-term I believe it is highly likely other countries will attempt to leave the EU.

Also Italy tends to benefit from the EU more than the UK (including getting money to help with the immigrants, though many also feel it also stops Italy from doing the more aggressive actions some want).

So no EU country's government would, however populist, call a referendum on leaving the EU or eurozone if they thought there was any likelihood of voters choosing to Leave. Since the UK Conservative government miscalculated  and called a referendum which it then lost (they thought Remain would easily win) I would expect other country's governments to learn from the UK's mistake. \nOther populist movements that are not in government will have noticed that in the UK, UKIP appeared to be political force and certainly influenced UK government policy without being in government because it could make all sorts of claims about the supposed benefits of leaving the EU, but as soon as the referendum was won by Leave, UKIP's support faded and 18 months later it has virtually disappeared. The lesson seems to be that populists ideas, particularly anti-EU ideas, will appeal to a sizable proportion of voters, specifically those who do not want to think through the consequences, but if these ideas cannot be turned into easy to implement actions that do not cause any negative consequence for their supporters, the populists supporters will melt away.    \nSo my conclusion is that as far as calling for anti-EU referendums is concerned, for populists, its better to get your supports to believe voting for you is a way of traveling hopefully toward Leaving, but be very sure there is no danger of arriving.
