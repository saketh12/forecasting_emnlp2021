I'd be willing to make about a 100-to-1 bet in favor but not much lower, so let's say there's a 99% chance that there referendum will be held by the end of 2017. For the moment, I'm going to ignore this possibility, but I'll factor it back into the mix later. And I think it's safe to assume that the date for the vote would have to be announced no later than the end of September 2017. It's now (roughly) half of the way through February, so in order for Britain to set a date for the Brexit vote before the end of 2017, it has to do so in the remaining 19.5 months. Assuming that the date on which the Brexit vote is set is randomly determined, the probability of that Britain will set a date prior to May 1, 2016 is 1.0-(17/19.5) = 0.128. Why?
