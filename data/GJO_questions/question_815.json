Lighthizer told reporters later that every effort would be made to include Canada, even if it took weeks or longer for them to sign on to changes. And Mexican leaders also said Canada must be included in the deal.\n          There were also signs of division about what the agreement means for NAFTA.

Assuming that these are won by the leftist AMLO, will the current Mexican administration even dare to bring a revised NAFTA deal to their Congress in the interim period before the new President gets into office on December 1? I doubt. Sure, it may be possible to conclude a deal that exempts Canada and Mexico from the steel/aluminum tariffs in exchange for concessions on their part. But ratification will probably have to wait the new President of Mexico. Meanwhile, Trump may get impatient and issue the notice to apply pressure.

Leaving aside Trump's reported \"enthusiasm\" for the deal, it looks like there would be a serious attempt to resolve the main issues in a freshly-scheduled 8th round of talks in DC in April. The Mexican officials also appear to want this, perhaps scared of the persistent lead of the leftist AMLO in the presidential elections' opinion polls. (I suppose they hope that if the issues are closed, AMLO may choose not to reopen them, while if the negotiations continue, his pre-election rhetorics may force him to take a harder stand.) For a deal \"in principle\" to be reached in April, Mexico and Canada would have to be very flexible, which may indeed be the case if Trump's recent actions scared them. But it won't be easy - I give the deal a chance of some 60%. In any event, a deal in April all but removes the need of a notice.

Now that it's clear that Canada and Mexico are excluded from the steel & aluminum tariffs, let's think what might be the impact of the tariff saga on the outcome of this question. Trump threatened to impose these tariffs on the US NAFTA partners if no NAFTA deal to his liking is reached - and then backed off. How to read this? On the one hand, Trump did show that he is willing to break - or at least make more costly - established free-trade links. On the other hand, he backed off somewhat under pressure from free-trade Republicans. One way to read this is that Mexico and Canada have to show some more flexibility in the NAFTA talks - to give Trump some victories to ward off bigger disasters. If they go this way, the chance of a notice to withdraw declines. On the other hand, Mexico and Canada may feel emboldened by the support they received from most of the American political class in the tariff discussion and refuse to give in on the substantial issues. This would increase the chance of a notice - as a pressure instrument if nothing more. On the third hand, Trump showed once again his negotiating tactics - throw a big bomb first, alarm everybody, and then scale down the actual policy action. It's not inconceivable he may do the same with a notice to withdraw. But timing would be important here - if it's clear that the NAFTA talks cannot be finished on the original schedule and have to continue after the Mexican elections, will Trump issue the notice before the talks are finished? I think not - such a notice is not a vote-gainer for the Republican party overall (it may energize the anti-trade base, but will repel the business groups, and many Democrats are anti-trade as well). On balance, I still think the most likely scenario is that NAFTA talks continue through October 1 (and probably into 2019, after the new Mexican administration gets into office on Dec 1). But there is a chance that a notice is issued before the deadline, and this chance seems slightly larger than before the tariff episode.

The US has quite a leverage over both Mexico and Canada, being the largest - by far - trading partner for both, so it's not inconceivable that some sort of an agreement can be reached, especially if the US negotiators moderate their demands a little. It's still less likely than 50/50, though. \n - the probability that a notice will be provided if renegotiations fail.

While walking away from a deal, or threaten to walk away, is a viable negotiation tactics, he won't use that unless necessary. For example, the first head of state Trump invited to the White House was the President of Mexico. The President of Mexico refused to meet him, thus lost an opportunity for negotiation. So far, Trump met with many heads of state, except the President of Mexico. That is negotiation 101 blunder from Mexico which Trump certainly will not make. Trump will threaten to walk away from the negotiation table only if he sees he could gain concession from Canada or Mexico.  You can't use that bluff too many times. \nTrump is agenda-driven. He will be focused in internal politics (mid-term election coming up) and China-North-Korea region (unless something else flairs up). And he could do both by focusing on China-North-Korea: the best way to help himself internally is to have a coherent foreign policy. \nWith the above, I would say Trump will not rock the NAFTA boat in 2018.
