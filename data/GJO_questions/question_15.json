Turkish President Recep Erdogan will likely direct his attention inward over the coming months in order to purge his domestic rivals and consolidate his power. This distraction will likely disrupt the flow of material, financial, and intelligence support provided to opposition groups by Turkey, enabling short-term military gains by a number of actors including Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS). The Syrian Kurdish YPG may also exploit this moment in order to take further steps towards the establishment of an autonomous federal region along the Syrian-Turkish Border while Turkey remains incapable of mustering a coherent military response. At the same time, the ongoing political instability threatens the continued ability of the U.S.-led anti-ISIS coalition to conduct air operations out of Incirlik Airbase in Southern Turkey, presenting a complication to ongoing military efforts that could slow the current momentum against ISIS in Northern Syria. Over the long-term, the ongoing purges will likely allow Erdogan to remove the internal obstacles that prevented him from pursuing deeper intervention into the Syrian Civil War, including the provision of advanced weapons to the opposition or the establishment of a \u2018safe zone\u2019 along the border. Erdogan will likely augment these policies with expanded aid to Salafi-Jihadist groups such as Ahrar al-Sham that provide a support network for Al-Qaeda in Syria.

So on the face of it Putin's idea does not seem to have any possibility of happening. However Putin does not say things without a reason, so the question is why did Putin mention elections at all? It could be that Putin has realised that his airpower is not going to win the war for Assad. If so the options are for Iran to send in large numbers of ground troops (which would upset the Sunni states and US), or Russia to send in a lot of ground troops, which could see Russia bogged down in an unwinnable war similar to what happened in Afghanistan in the 1980s or for some way be found so that Russia and Iran can get out of Syria without loss of face. A \"peace\" plan/cease fire with Assad \"retiring\" and some other figurehead taking over the Syrian government could be proposed. (A bit like the way that the US got out of Vietnam). Even this scenario is difficult to pull off as there is no sign of all parties being willing to talk, but Assad \"retiring\" could be seen as a concession.

So in the autumn of 2013 they decided to take steps against the extremists without going through political channels, by providing US intelligence to the militaries of other nations, on the understanding that it would be passed on to the Syrian army and used against the common enemy, Jabhat al-Nusra and Islamic State.\nhttp://www.lrb.co.uk/v38/n01/seymour-m-hersh/military-to-military\n \u2018We weren\u2019t intent on deviating from Obama\u2019s stated policies,\u2019 the adviser said. \u2018But sharing our assessments via the military-to-military relationships with other countries could prove productive. It was clear that Assad needed better tactical intelligence and operational advice. The JCS concluded that if those needs were met, the overall fight against Islamist terrorism would be enhanced. Obama didn\u2019t know, but Obama doesn\u2019t know what the JCS does in every circumstance and that\u2019s true of all presidents.\u2019"], [1056, "2015-12-24T05:21:26Z", 0.15, "A story about U.S. contacts with Assad below.

If the cease-fire holds, then the process of putting together a political settlement begins. The very last phase would include elections and a transition.

I interpret the trip as a message to Iran that Russia is now the dominant power in Syria, and Assad's survival no longer depends on Iran. Now, Iran is the junior partner to Russia, and Putin calls the shots. When Assad calls for a comprehensive peace including all the ethnic and religious groups in Syria, we have to remember that he's from a minority himself. I think what he's doing is offering himself as an anti-ISIS rallying point. If you are a Christian, Druze, or Shiite, or even a Sunni who dreads rule by ISIS, Assad starts to look pretty good. I don't consider his statements an offer to step down, or for a \"transition\" (which the NYT called it, not Assad). It's an offer by Putin to combat ISIS, on the condition that Assad stays in power. I doubt if the Russia-Saudi Arabia-Turkey meeting will discuss replacing Assad. It will probably entail a proposal by Russia for all factions in Syria, and their sponsors, to unite against ISIS.
