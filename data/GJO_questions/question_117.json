MENA is gray\nprecisely because it is impossible to identify, focus on, and pace against a well-defined\nand manageable set of defense-relevant challenges. In MENA, the environment and the\ntrends driving it are in fact the principal adversaries.\nComplexity in the MENA region means that any U.S. action has the potential to\ncreate even greater challenges for the United States and its partners. Further, the wide\ndiversity of threat types makes first order prioritization challenging for senior decisionmakers.\nMENA boasts a potential nuclear power with a penchant for destabilizing regional\nproxy wars; a series of state-killing civil conflicts; myriad extremist groups that\nemerge from and thrive on endemic regional instability; and generalized rejectionist\ntrends that fast undermine the authority and reach of even the region\u2019s most capable\nstates. Action against one or more of these will inevitably affect the nature and magnitude\nof risk associated with others.\nThe 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq is the first of many clear examples in this regard.\nIn large measure, there is an expert consensus that the United States is where it is in Iraq\nand Syria precisely because of the deliberate collapse of Saddam Hussein\u2019s regime.197 On\na smaller scale, Libya and Yemen also demonstrate the risk of U.S. action. In a desire to\nimprove its position, U.S. actions contributed to a collapse of both Libya and Yemen.\nThis collapse led to a security vacuum followed by rampant instability.\nA newfound U.S. Government appreciation of the risks of action have led it at times\nto embrace inaction or limited action in the region. In Syria, many perceive that U.S.\ninaction allowed the situation to worsen.198 Further, it opened new unhelpful operating\nspace for U.S. adversaries. Russia and Iran, for example, are perceived to have seized\non U.S. hesitation to more actively aid the Assad regime.199 Similarly, many argue that\nAmerican passivity in the face of increasing violence and instability in Iraq between\n2010-2014 highlight the hazards of inaction as well. During that period, a more assertive\nU.S. commitment may have limited ISIL operating space and prevented its de facto\ncontrol over large areas of Iraqi territory.

Although Putin certainly has been toying with us and has no interest in supporting our interests, he has what I believe is a very strong desire to be viewed on the world stage as a first-world, global power broker (see all his current military actions), and that bringing Assad to the table would greatly inform this perception in his mind.

I suspect this is because he knows that he will be able to ensure that Assad can run in the election and likely is confident that he (and Assad) can control the election results in their favor.
