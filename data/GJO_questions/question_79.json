Like the business executive who seeks to co-ordinate business trips with personal activities (Florida in the winter) so as to accrue the intangible benefit (of sunshine) under a business expense reimbursement scheme, is it possible that Putin has demonstrated any historical proclivity to \"kill two birds with one stone\" by making trips which, on the surface appear to be for reason X, but behind-the-scenes may equally be for reason Y? I ask this because the S-300 delivery was apparently consummated under the auspices of Putin attending a regional gas conference. Might it be possible that Putin might wish to visit the United States at this time for some reason independent of the Nuclear Security Summit, and the Summit might be a useful cover for such a visit? Kerry will supposedly be in Moscow this week. There are, one would expect, continuous discussions between Washington and Moscow on a variety of subjects at a variety of levels. Perhaps there is some subject that percolates to the top, so to speak, where a face-to-face meeting between Putin and Obama would be important. Certainly such a meeting could occur independently of the Summit, but then the subject of the meeting becomes a special topic of (perhaps undesired) focus. To my mind Russia has more-or-less divorced themselves from the U.S.-led  Summit approach to nuclear security, and seems to be in favor of establishing the IAEA as the premier international body for this function. Why would they desire to support the \"Summit alternative\" to the IAEA?
