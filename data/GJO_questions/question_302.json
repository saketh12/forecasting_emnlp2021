Such agreement would effectively be a gift to Assad, without any reciprocal advantage for the U.S. How ever any of the other criteria of this question may be defined, the use of the word \"endorse\" has to mean an explicit statement by the U.S. that it accepts Assad's continuation in office, and/or the legitimacy of his seeking national executive power in Syria if he is temporarily replaced by an interim regime. The United States would gain absolutely nothing by making such an endorsement. The U.S. might cooperate with the Assad regime against ISIS, but to do so, it need not make any explicit endorsement of his continuation in power, and Assad is in no position to demand such an endorsement as the price of his cooperation with the U.S. Assad will be perfectly happy with the U.S. keeping its mouth shut about whether he should stay or go, and the U.S. will be perfectly happy to refrain from any rhetoric that might impede its promised campaign against ISIS.

The two extreme interpretations of this question are (a) that the US just announces that it will endorse a peace plan which allows Assad to remain in power without any other parties to the conflict having agree to the plan, and (b) that all combatant groups in the Syrian civil war agree a peace plan that includes a provision to allow Assad to remain in power and the US then announces that it will endorse this peace plan. \nIt seems to me that (b) is so unlikely that it is not worth taking the time making a forecast.

There are many conflicts that continue after some or most of the combatants have agreed a peace plan (e.g. Israel/Palestine Oslo peace plan in 1994 has not brought a total peace agreed by all parties, but the \"accord\" is still viewed as a \"peace plan\" in general sense.)   \nObviously other forecasters may disagree with my thoughts!\nAs the Syrian Government, Russia and Iran already appear happy for Assad to remain in place, and the UK has indicated that it is willing to consider Assad remaining in place, what seems to missing is it being stated in a more formal peace plan and the US endorsing it.   \nI think it is possible that the US could agree to do so before July.

Assad and the Russians want to beat Assad's enemies, not to make peace with them.  If they achieve this objective, there will be no peace plan. So for a peace plan to appear, Assad and the rebels need to reach a stalemate. And If the US stops supporting the rebels, this looks less likely.\nSecond, when would the US \"endorse\" such a plan? For this to happen, Islamist groups should be excluded (per Trump's statements that he wants to eliminate them). So the plan would involve some kind of settlement between Assad and the non-Islamic rebels, while leaving Islamists to be further attacked. Even if this is possible, there won't be peace - at least not until the Islamist groups are decisively defeated. \nIf the plan manages to get through these two hurdles, the third one - leaving Assad in power - should be easy to meet.

Amidst the eschatological angst, it is important at least to start by noting that \u2014 as every president has had to discover \u2014 he (and someday she) is just one person. Even an aligned Congress can act as a brake on some of the more lunatic or destructive policies, as will the very machinery of government. Besides, Trump gives little evidence of being details-oriented or having any clear sense of a vision, which will mean that he may well prove more willing to let the machine grind along, so long as he gets enough photo ops and adulatory mentions. Yes, there is no question that a Trump presidency will have serious, dangerous implications, but here the very framing of the US political system \u2014 designed, after all, to make executive power hard to apply \u2014 and his own limitations may be useful.\nIt\u2019s winter in Central Europe. Whether or not Trump actually means anything he said, especially his backpedalling from US commitments to the defence of NATO allies, nonetheless this must be a real concern in the Baltics and Central Europe. Ultimately, there is no reason to believe Russia has any territorial designs on NATO states, but it will, if it feels it has the chance, bully and intervene. More to the point, Ukraine, Georgia, Moldova, even Belarus are going to have to come to terms with a future in which they are unlikely to be able to count on serious Western support and protection. Putin may have pushed for a Yalta 2.0 division of Europe, but this election essentially hands him the half of that deal he wanted, by default.\nThe Kremlin\u2019s glee must be tinged with a degree of nervousness. Nonetheless, the Russians never expected Trump to win, and their calculus was based on trying to ensure a Clinton presidency was weakened from the gate. Yes, Trump has been bizarrely positive about Putin and there is the possibility of a Putin-Berlusconi-type mutual man-crush as ageing, soi disant alpha males find fellow reinforcement in each other. But much of the Kremlin\u2019s geopolitical playbook has been based on it being the unpredictable, risk-taking party, relying on the West to be the responsible adult, the force for stability and reason. Trump\u2019s friendship is hardly an asset on which to rely, and his balance an even less stable foundation. The Kremlin might actually feel it has to be a little more cautious and predictable, precisely because it is dealing with someone who actually internalizes the kind of devil-may-care belligerence Putin affects.\nSyria will burn. Between Trump\u2019s open desire to get some more bombs dropped, and his expressed willingness to deal with the Assad regime as a lesser evil to Islamic States, we can expect no push for peace and regime change in Syria. Eastern Aleppo may itself prove a harbinger of this war.\nHistory restarts, and democracy loses some of its force of appeal. The notion that the end of the Soviet idea in 1991 meant that history had ended and liberal democracy had won has long been debunked, but this is pretty much the final spadeful of earth on its coffin. It is unlikely that, for the moment, American democracy will have anything like the same power of example, just at the time when Europe is in a populism and legitimacy crisis of its own.\nThe security concerns are global. Trump appears to be unconcerned with climate change \u2014 the single greatest global security threat \u2014 and almost relishing a more confrontational approach to geopolitics. I can hardly see him interested in development aid, or disaster relief, or humanitarian foreign politics in general; his basic calculus appears to be a short-termist profit maximization for USA Inc. This is bad for everyone, whether American or Zimbabwean, or from somewhere in between.\nSome hope at the bottom of Pandora\u2019s box. There always needs to be some hope, but I confess this morning I am scrabbling around in the corners of this particular Pandora\u2019s box to find any.
