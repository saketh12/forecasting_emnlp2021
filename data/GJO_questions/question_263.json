I think an EDIS is a good idea, but there is zero chance of an agreement to set one up before 1 Apr 2017.

(Banks is some \"safe\" countries might be a higher risk than the voters think, but the voters are right to believe that the \"safe\" countries do have national balance sheets that could bail out depositors). \nAnother complication is that an EDIS could be for only banks in the Euro Zone or for all banks in the EU. It would seem very unlikely that post Brexit vote an EDIS that included the UK would be proposed. \nThe actual question concerns not the EU Commission or  EU Council of Ministers, but only the EU Parliament. The EU Parliament has already published the list of matters than it intends to work on over the remainder of this year, and there is no mention (that I can see) of an EDIS.  We know that French elections will be coming up early in 2017, followed a few months later by German elections.
