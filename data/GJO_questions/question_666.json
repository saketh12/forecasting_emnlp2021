The 36-foot-tall missile had a squat, snub-nosed frame and used a liquid propellent more powerful than the kerosene-based fuels the North Koreans had used in the past, potentially allowing it to fly farther, with heavier payloads.\nThe missile was dubbed the Hwasong-10, or Musudan. But experts noted striking similarities to the R-27 Zyb, or Ripple, manufactured by the Makeyev Rocket Design Bureau. Two months later, on Aug. 24, 2016, North Korea successfully tested the Pukguksong-1, a submarine-launched missile that also incorporates some features from the Zyb. Both models are \u201cgenerally regarded as derived from the designs of the Makeyev Bureau\u2019s R-27,\u201d said Joshua Pollack, an analyst at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies in Monterey, Calif.\nThose two tests were followed in recent months by even greater technological leaps, culminating in the successful tests this year of North Korea\u2019s first true intercontinental ballistic missiles, capable of reaching every city in the continental United States. There have been no further tests of the Musudan, but satellite images released this month show that North Korea is building floating barges thought to be intended for tests of new submarine-launched missiles. The construction is occurring in two different ports on opposite sides of the country.\nU.S. analysts also believe that North Korea is working on an improved version of the Pukguksong.\""], [42233, "2017-12-31T06:15:42Z", 0.0, "That would warrant an assured response from not only the US but regional actors as well.
