However, it will take longer, than the current US backed government will be able to stay in power due to deteriorating economical situation. Ukraine does not have an alternative business model in regards to all aspect of the life, economical, cultural, religious, etc. than to be associated with Russia. This is yet again a failing project of the current US government and Pentagon, which slowly by slowly becomes a threat to world peace. US is becoming a fascistic country. We all will pay the price for not acting to stop this development. The mantra of materialism has made the US population unable to withstand the sweet poison, the convenient life. Using up 40% of all goods produced in the world the US is consuming 8 times more it should. In order to maintain this level of consumption other nations needs to be exploited. The tools to do it is providing the Petro - US$ scheme where crude oil is traded in US Dollar only. However, Russia and China, and many other countries are resisting this status quo. There will be only two ways out - reasonable adjustment of the US to more fair play, or WWIII.

Unfortunately, this event is most probable if the current government tries to reach a settlement on the Donbas issue with Russia.
