Assuming that the most likely scenario for another mid-air incident is between the US and China, then that suggests a probability on the order of 1/5600, assuming the US flies through the area every day. China has been stepping up it's aerial activities and aggression in the area recently, I seem to be able to recall recently news of 2 close calls of similar incidents between the US and China air power projection. Even a ten fold increase in the observed risk would only mean a roughly 0.2% chance of some similar incident to happen. The probability of a purposeful military operation that causes human casualties is likely significantly less than 1%, as it does not appear to be in anyone's strategic interests to do so. The interaction between coast guards, like the incident with the Indonesian coast guard's capture of a Chinese fishing vessel, seems to be the most likely mode for some interaction to lead to a fatality. A European Maritime Safety Agency report for 2013 shows that there were 75 fatalities with 2782 ships involved. Each incident may have involved more than one fatality (this includes the grounding of a ferry off the coast of Italy that claimed 25 lives) but also more than one ship may have been involved in a single incident. If those two adjustments cancel, then we get a guess of just under 3% probability of a fatal incident occurring from some sort of a ship to ship interaction. Given that fishing ships are constantly trolling the area (both legally and illegally), the opportunity for some sort of confrontation seems high (perhaps occurring on a daily basis), though the chance of a ramming like the one this March is likely significantly lower than that. If we guess there are somewhere between 2 and 3 incidents of a ship to ship contact from now till the end of the year, that gives a probability that one of these will end in a fatality between 5 and 8%. Call that 6.5%.

It is unlikely in the extreme that an intentional lethal confrontation would arise, however China does have a history of engaging in erratic and risky behavior. Any lethal confrontation is most likely to arise from a miscalculation by the individuals involved in operations in the area. For example the mid air collision of a Chinese fighter with a US spy plane in 2001 was most likely due to the reckless behavior of the Chinese pilot. More recently China has been known to ram free fishing vessels that have been captured by Coast Guards operating in the South China Sea (most notably Indonesia).

A less obvious factor might be 'peak stuff' in the industrial economies, which could impact exports of consumer goods while emerging economies are in recession and internal demand is still weak.\nI think many of these chickens will be coming home to roost in 2016, and authoritarian regimes under pressure tend to be aggressive, this is one side of my high probability.

The elephant of the US navy makes it difficult and disadvantageous for China to engage in any potential military confrontation in disputed waters/ islands in S or E China sea for the immediate future. Japan's new interpretation of its pacifist constitution and the alliance withe US makes any E China sea confrontation unlikely. The Philippine navy is too weak and almost totally relies on the US which lowers any risk of lethal confrontation with its naval or coast guard forces.

It has played a deliberately non-confrontational hand in diplomatic conflict interactions despite the its surface-level braggadocios showmanship towards the use of politico-military aggression to assert itself in global relations. This balance and unpredictability in China's presentation, as well as the very real economic leverage it possesses over the other countries in the east-china-sea region to refrain from any insurrectionist activity that may eventually cost them. The stakes are much higher for China's opposition if they oppose the territorial embankment of the region so I think they will just stand by and allow it to happen without much rebuttal, to China's advantage (since I don't believe, China is looking for regional conflict either.) Japan is the only country with some amount of international political leverage, connectivity and influence (despite their debt which does limit what their able to do economically to resist China's assertion of control of the region and its resources.) Japan may well rally the other countries in the region and with the support of the US and the EU, may be able to mount some opposition to China's advancement or at least slow the process through international negotiations. I don't expect lethal confrontation because I don't think the aforementioned of China's creditors will advocate for the avoidance of military intervention as much as possible and Japan will refrain from going it alone unless it is able to rally other countries such as South Korea in the region to put up a collectively front in the region but South Korea will listen to the US, not japan. But if there is a collective regional opposition to China's advancement (given that 25% chance), certainly with opposing water vessels running into each other on occasion, some folks are bound to die in the absence of deconfliction agreements over the territory given the high stakes."], [9613, "2015-11-03T21:16:53Z", 0.6, "The PLA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s development of the anti-ship ballistic missile system and 60 years preparing for such a confrontation increase the likelihood."], [2207, "2015-11-03T21:16:19Z", 0.05, "People expecting violence in the South China Sea in the near term do not understand China's view of itself in the world, or Chinese culture.

The current climate is one of upheaval in Asia and the U.S. is backing out of a global leadership position.  They are expanding now because they see very little resistance to doing so, other than some empty statements from U.S. officials and President Obama.  The Chinese prefer to expand without force, until it is sufficiently positioned such that force becomes irrelevant.  That is the basis for the base they have built.
