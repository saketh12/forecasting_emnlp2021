I think there is only a 5% chance that SCOTUS will not find that the statute implicates 1st amendment rights under the specific circumstances of this case. I do actually think there is a 95% chance that SCOTUS will rule that 1st amendment rights are implicated here, but that does not mean they will invalidate the statute. More likely a compromise would be reached within the current Court. They will definitely recognize his religious liberties and wax poetic about that. But they will also wax poetic about LGBTQ rights, and the rights of artists like cake designers since that is the hook the cake shop is using. To balance these rights they will likely keep the anti-discrimination statute but allow an \"out\" of sorts. My best guess is that they will make it clear that such statutes cannot apply to businesses that are not open to the public. A business that is open to the public must serve the public. They cannot refuse a customer for discriminatory reasons. The only way for the cake shop to operate legally and decline customers such as these would be to change their business model to not be open to the public. So everyone wins. The cake designer and other persons at a business whose religious beliefs are violated by such a statute are free to do several things that may be mentioned in the opinion. They can leave their job, change locations to somewhere not covered by such a statute (eg, the feds have no such anti-discrimination statute and the majority of states do not yet either), engage in the political process to repeal or amend such a statute, or the one I think is most likely to happen: close their doors to the public and be completely be appointment only (like commissioning a painting or any kind of creative work by an artist. They could invoke copyright law and possibly say that the author of any copyrightable work has the right to decline to produce such a work, but only if they are not operating as a place of public accomodation open to the public.
