In the case of a smaller scale event, such as threatening the lives of employees in specific areas of the plant, it would not be publicly disclosed.\n  There are many foreign governments with nuclear programs that work with major civilian nuclear energy systems, such as Turkey.   An attack would undermine public trust in civilian nuclear energy.  Knowing that an attack would undermine civilian nuclear energy a lifelong scholar that is working in a civilian nuclear energy program would be unwilling to participate in that attack.   While participation could be coerced, the complexity of a remote attack would make it impossible for one person or a small group to pull off under duress.   I think an attack by a government currently cooperating in civilian nuclear energy programs will not happen in 2016.\n  The last possible is someone without knowledge in civilian nuclear systems attacking a system remotely.  This is very possible, but it is not possible that anyone achieve an ends without understanding the systems involved. If an attack of this unprepared kind were to happen there would be no result and it would not be disclosed publicly.\n  I think it is not probable at all that there is a real attack on nuclear facilities disclosed to the public.
