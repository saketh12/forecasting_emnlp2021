In this case, I do not think that past confirmation likelihoods are as relevant because of the circumstances (otherwise, my estimate would be far higher). Here, because the appointment is contingent on presidential nomination, Senate judiciary committee recommendation, and full Senate approval, there are several key players involved and many strategic positions to consider. The first is President Obama, who has said that he will nominate someone to fill the Court's vacancy. As a political move, it may be best for him to nominate someone who he knows may not get approved so that it doesn't hurt the chances of someone who could actually get approved if nominated by the next president. It seems from the media and from statements made by Obama that he is resolute to nominate someone qualified; but beyond that, the power rests in the hands of members of the Senate and potential the presidential candidates. For these reasons, I will continue to update as the presidential election unfolds and once he nominates someone, to account for how qualified or controversial they are.
