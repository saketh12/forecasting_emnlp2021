As mentioned by Mr. Kumar each year farther from the previous pandemic can mean an increase in the odds that the next one will come around.  Second the world continues at a rapid pace to urbanize and since the last pandemic significantly greater actual numbers of humans as well as a % of humans are living in close contact with each other.  This will mean easier to spread quickly among the population.\nGreater numbers of humans travel and to all areas of the world but again usually passing through major population area no matter what the final destination may be and therefore the spread can quickly become regional or worldwide which would create the pandemic label.\nMigration is growing and uncontrolled movement of great numbers of people add to the risks of quickly spreading viruse.\nFinally it generally the case that the very old are most at risk and we are now in a world with a never before seen number and % of the human population as older more vulnerable persons.  Therefore the influenza when it hits will find a significantly larger number of hosts than anytime previously.\nI sincerely hope I am wrong but I see a lot of reason for us to be vigilant.
