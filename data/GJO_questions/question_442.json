On the face of it their desire for changing or scrapping the agreement is the current difficulty of forming a Northern Ireland  Government, but there is a strong suspicion is that their real motive is that the GFA creates a problem for Brexit (only Brexiteers have suggested that the GFA needs to be changed).

Both the DUP and UK government are less in control than they appear. The UK Government depends of Parliamentary support in Westminster from the DUP, so has no leverage over the DUP in creating a new devolved NI government. The DUP risks pushing opinion in the UK in general and in NI in particular towards the idea that a united Ireland would be less trouble that the status quo. For example a United Ireland would solve the Irish border problem that could wreck Brexit so Brexiteers might see the DUP as a Brexit block, but without the DUP May's government would fall so maybe there would be no Brexit.

The problem of what Brexit deal would keep the Irish border totally open is made clear, but the consequence of not keeping it open is not fully explored, but only considered in relation to the DUP support for the May government. If the UK proposes a deal with the EU that would result in a hard Irish border the polls show that most voters in N. I. would support the idea of a referendum to unite with Ireland. Bloomberg have considered what the DUP might do in that case, but have not considered that the DUP's views do not match the majority view of Brexit (most in N.I. were against Brexit) nor that the peace agreement requires that if the population demands it a referendum on a united Ireland must be held. The polls also show that if the Brexit deal would result in a hard Irish border and a referendum on a united Ireland were called it would (according to the recent polls) result in a united Ireland. This is regardless of the support for the political parties, and regardless of religious background. Breaking up the U.K. is not something that the Conservative Party of Mrs May would contemplate. For many of its voters that would be a worse outcome than no Brexit. \nSo in my view the question of a united Ireland referendum is part of a row of dominoes; if May insists on leaving the EU Single Market and Customs Union a hard Irish border becomes certain; if there is a hard Irish border, N.I. would unite with Ireland and leave the UK (with the risk that Scotland would also leave the UK); the breakup of the UK is not what the Brexit supporters want; so the UK will not risk it happening. If N.I remains in the Single Market/Customs union in order keep the Irish border open, but the rest of the UK does not that will still lead to demands for a united Ireland (and for Scotland to have a similar deal.) \nSo which ever way May's government approaches it, the logical contradictions do not allow both leaving the EU Single Market/Customs union and keeping an open border with Ireland.

However the risk (as far as the UK Government would see it) of having NI leave the UK in the event of  a Brexit No-Deal will be another incentive to try very hard to get a Brexit deal. (The only Brexit deal that is likely to be on offer is for the UK to leave the EU but remain in the Single Market and Customs Union - I have just re-read the phase 1 agreement document and can see no other way to meet the 1998 NI Peace Agreement obligations as described in the phase 1 agreement; the UK has agreed to the  alignment of NI, UK and EU laws for far more than just cross border trade.)"], [15425, "2017-12-10T07:10:24Z", 0.0, "Initial forecast"], [1034, "2017-11-28T07:44:13Z", 0.0, "Ireland on the verge of snap election as crisis deepens"], [14493, "2017-11-25T10:34:15Z", 0.0, "If the EU/UK Brexit talks start to look as if they will result in a hard border being reinstated between Eire and Northern Ireland the public mood in N.I could change, and demands for a United Ireland could arise. As the UK economy in general and N.I. economy in particular seem to be heading for permanent low growth the risk of a United Ireland might seem more attractive. Clearly a united Ireland would not appeal to all in N.I. and a referendum would be very divisive, so the UK government would try and avoid anything that encourages the idea. For this reason the UK priority will be (ought to be) to avoid giving any reason for people in N.I. to think a United Ireland would be better than remaining in the UK. For that reason having an open border with Eire even if it means N.I. staying in the EU Customs Union is a lower risk than having a hard border. If Republicans don't like the Brexit deal they can campaign to resolve it by uniting with Eire; if the Unionists don't like the Brexit deal all they could do would be to allow May's UK government to fall, which would probably result in a new UK government without the DUP that would still not give the Unionists what they wanted. So regarding the Customs Union and N.I it seems to be \"heads I win, tails you lose\".\nI think the real question will turn out to be does the whole UK remain in the EU Customs Union or is N.I, in and the rest of the UK out.
