The quote by Deputy Prime Minister Morgulov  reference political differences \"need to be freed as soon as possible\" signals time is of the essence, at least from the Russians. Which is consistent with Putins increasingly difficult geopolitical and domestic calculations. With no real OPEC agreement on limiting oil production on the horizon ( NB: upcoming meeting looks fraught w/ uncertainties), Putin will from a domestic perspective can argue internally to Russians \"job well done for the time being in Russian\".  That said, the gap left by the price of oil today relative to their ongoing budget requirements leaves Russia still close to dire economic straights. Carrying out his shorter term Syrian objectives had substantial financial cost as well.  And, one might argue, both the naval and, military base in Tartus will continue to generate substantial cost. Clearly, a significant interest to his overall ME strategy. Putin now stepping back for the time being in Syria will not be enough to generate a return to reasonable economic conditions. He needs to show internally he has proper plans in place to improve economic development in Russia.

Hunting for the right information, I began with the simple statement made by the Russian government: \u201cWe do not see any possibility to take part in the preparations for the Fourth Summit on Nuclear Security.\u201d Russia is known to be controversial in many of their views, so I started at what I consider a high 20% likelihood based on this statement alone. After some more research, it became clear that Russia sent their foreign minister to attend in 2014, and since then Russia has stated no new agenda items have come up that would instill a desire to participate. Looking further back at these summits, Putin has never actually attended, leading no reason to believe he would attend this year. Combined with Putin\u2019s hothead personality who doesn\u2019t go back on statements, I reduced the forecast to 6%. In reasoning, however, I also looked to other key players who can influence this decision in the opposite direction. Specifically, North Korea recently tested a hydrogen bomb. Because of Putin\u2019s proximity to North Korea and the global concern with their tactics, he might feel compelled to attend the summit and play a dominating role about how to curb North Korea (likely with some underlying political interests here).

Seems possible US & Japan (not going willingly) could increase the conflict between Russia and Japan.\n.......Background (from the \"more Info\" links and sub-links). Russia and Japan both want negotiations.  Japan and Russia have never settled WWII, due to the Kurile/Northern Territory issue.  Russia is pushing for the meetings in it's effort to maintain foreign relations in response to western pressure.  Putin and Abe met at the 2014 APEC summit, and postponed a Putin visit in 2014 due to US pressure over Ukraine.  Japan, under pressure, also placed sanctions on Russia. They agreed to postpone until an appropriate time in 2015.  Putin and Abe again met at the 2015 UN general Assembley in September. They agreed to meet at the G20 and/or APEC summits in November, and Abe issued an invitation for Putin to visit when \"outcomes in the peace negotiations and economic areas could be arraigned\".  Everything seemed to depend on progress in Ukraine, except now Syria....
