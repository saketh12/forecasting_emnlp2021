The disruption to the newspaper business has been largely due to the move of classified advertising away from newspapers, and the relatively costly expense of distribution. Weekly magazines suffer from these problems less than daily local papers. I see no reason why weekly magazines sold by the annual subscription model cannot continue after we get most of the 'news\" electronically.  The daily news, online or in print is (or was) mainly reporting facts (often incorrect facts) while the news magazine is more about fitting the facts into a bigger picture of what the facts will mean mean to the readers in a longer time frame (e.g. its current affairs). \nSo if I take a guess that the decline in newspapers will bottom out in the next four years or so (say 50 months) and that while lots of local news papers will stop the print edition, it will perhaps result in 25% of weekly news magazines stopping their print editions that would suggest that no more than 0.5% of news magazines will stop their print editions each month.  \nhttp://newspaperdeathwatch.com/\nIts seems that newspapers (not magazines) in the US have been closing print editions at a rate of less than 2.5% a year which would suggest that my guess of 0.5% a month is too high and that 0.2% a month is a closer estimate. If so with only 3 months to go in 2016 the likelihood of any one newspaper closing its print edition is only around 0.6%.

(-2) Some observations/interpretations:\n1) They achieved \"crossover\" on advertising, where increase in digital advertising revenue exceeded decrease in print revenue. Digital advertising revenue increased at an impressive 65%, whereas print revenue decreased by 13%. It is unclear if the crossover in terms of profitability has occurred.\n2) \"Excluding Viant acquisition, digital advertising revenue would have increased 10% year over year.\" Without knowing how they account for intra-company sales, it is difficult to know exactly how to interpret this statement. On the surface, however, this is a rather shocking statement. By \"on the surface\" I mean that the ad sales from the \"digitalization\" of everything Time had prior to Viant, as well all the other non-Viant digital acquisitions, increased by only 10%. This seems like they are unable to touch new customers with existing products.\n3) As I read the financials, they burned through $331 million in cash for the quarter. This is an unsustainable rate (although by definition any negative cashflow is unsustainable). Recent announcements of personnel cuts will reduce editorial costs, but will not likely be enough to cover the negative cashflow by itself. Without knowing what the net estimated savings would be in terms of a TIME frequency change we are very much in the dark, but looking to production costs as the next area to cut would mean that such a change in frequency may very much be on the table. Something needs to give with the cashflow.\n4) The share price for Time Inc. declined by 8.43% on heavy volume today. With the announcement of the regular dividend, this stock has a yield of 4.9%.\n5) Time Inc. continues to claim that they are in the acquisitive mode, although I do not know where they would find the cash. I would not be surprised if they themselves were acquired by the likes of Verizon (although with the decline in share price today it does not seem that the market anticipates this scenario).\n6) I have recently begun hearing media commentators refer to TIME not as a \"news\" magazine, but as a \"political\" magazine.

My impressions are only based on a dozen or so such visits since the inception of this Question. My observations were limited by the fact that I employ a number of various script and ad-blockers with my browser. First, perhaps because of my blockers, I am not seeing any advertising at all for the bulk of my visits. As a recommendation to TIME, they should deliver some classy, non-obtrusive, minimal, single advertisement to every visitor by default (if blockers prevent generation of a custom ad). Second, for those ads that are delivered (I don't know why sometimes and sometimes not), the advertisers are of the type I identified previously in my anecdotal survey of a printed issue (https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/90552 ); namely, very large corporations with massive advertising budgets placing \"image\" (versus product) placements. These advertisements were not just pick-ups of those in the printed issue. So, I'm thinking, and the whole point of this post, is that Time Inc. (or TIME) may be making big progress in improving its online advertising revenue. One could imagine that if a sufficient set of these very large (big ad budget) corporations (e.g., IBM) could be corralled with some type of multi-year special relationship (and price) \"bundle\" arrangement, Time Inc. might very well find the funds necessary to \"cut-the-cord\" (a bit at least) on the print side.

Big pharma (many), insurance companies (many), AARP and other senior citizen groups, banks, Volkswagen (curious), US Ad Council, and Mexican vacations. Plus an Amazon and another ad that likely reflects some traded advertising as part of their recent strategic relationships. In general, I saw the advertisers as representing very large firms with massive advertising budgets that are probably not required to justify their advertising spend in terms of effectiveness. It's image (versus product) advertising dollars that are farmed through agencies and the like. It would be just that collection of advertisers if there was some group that wanted to support a mainstream narrative of reality.
